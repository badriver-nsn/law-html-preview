Prior Codifications \u00a71.21.140 was formerly codified as 121.14 Commentary The standard of review defines the relationship between the trial court and the appeals court. The standard of review seeks to allocate to each court that part of the judicial work which it can best do. The trial court is in the best position to weigh the evidence and assess witness credibility and is therefore sustained on such matters unless its findings are clearly erroneous. The trial court is in no better position to interpret the law than the appeals court; in fact, the appeals court has the luxury of being able to analyze the law away from the heat of trial and can better perform this task itself. The appeals court can therefore look at questions of law afresh and need not defer at all to the trial court. Discretionary questions by their nature, can result in different decisions when put to different decision makers. The function of the appeals court in reviewing a discretionary decision is not to itself decide the result it would choose, but to determine whether the trial court in fact exercised discretion and made a decision based on the applicable facts and law. The exercise of discretion is more than bald decision making and it is the task of the appeals court to see that the appropriate process was followed. Specific instances of common standard of review problems are listed in this section; for instance the definition of sentencing as a discretionary determination. These instances are not exclusive. The Tribal Council may provide by ordinance and the courts by decision the classification of other matters as factual, legal, or discretionary.", "num": "1.21.140", "path": "library|Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa Indians Tribal Code|1|1.21|1.21.140", "title": "1.21.140 Standard of Review", "url": "/us/nsn/badriver/council/code/1.21.140"}

The trial court should have the first opportunity to consider all issues in litigation and to see as only it can do that the record is fully developed. Subsection (b) protects the court and parties from expending energy on issues that an appellant has no intention of pursuing.

The exception to this rule is the type of case that may occur again but is likely never to survive long enough to receive appellate review. For instance, an individual may wish to challenge a court's suspension of his hunting and fishing rights for a period of three months, but by the completion of the appellate briefing schedule the suspension would be ended and the case moot.

It includes a day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month, year-to- year or other recurring interval of time, the period being determined by the intent of the parties under the circumstances, with the interval between rent-paying dates normally evidencing that intent. (c) \"Premises\" mean the property covered by the lease, including not only the realty and fixtures, but also any personal property furnished with the realty. (d) \"Tenancy\" includes a tenancy under a lease, a periodic tenancy or a tenancy at will. (e) \"Tenant at will\" means any tenant holding the permission of his landlord without a valid lease and under circumstances not involving periodic payment of rent; but a person holding possession of real property under a contract of purchase or an employment contract is not a tenant under this chapter .

{"body": "Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa Indians Tribal Code. 1.24.050 Requirement of Writing for Rental Agreements and Termination (a) A lease for more than a year, or a contract to make such a lease or the assignment of any leasehold interest of more than a year, is not enforceable unless it is in writing and in addition sets forth the amount of rent or other consideration, the time of commencement and expiration of the lease and a reasonably definite description of the premises, or unless a writing signed by the landlord and the tenant sets forth the amount of rent or other consideration, the duration of the lease and a reasonably definite description of the premises and the commencement date is established by entry of the tenant into possession under the writing. Sections 124.6 and 124.8 govern as to matters within the scope of such sections and not provided for in such written lease or contract. (b) Possession under unenforceable lease. If a tenant enters into possession under a lease for more than one year which does not meet the requirements of sub. (a), and the tenant pays rent on a periodic basis, he becomes a periodic tenant. Except for duration of the tenancy and matters within the scope of Section 1.24.060 and 124.8, the tenancy is governed by the terms and conditions agreed upon. (c) Termination of written lease prior to normal expiration date. An agreement to terminate a tenancy more than one year prior to the expiration date specified in a valid written lease is not enforceable unless it is in writing signed by both parties. Any other agreement between the landlord and tenant to terminate a lease prior to its normal expiration date or to termination a periodic tenancy or tenancy at will without the notice required by Section 1.24.120 may be either oral or written.

{"body": "Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa Indians Tribal Code. 1.24.060 Rights and Duties of Landlord and Tenant in Absence of Written Agreement to Contrary (a) When section applicable. So far as applicable, this section governs the rights and duties of the landlord and tenant in the absence of any inconsistent provision in writing signed by both the landlord and the tenant. This section applies to any tenancy. (b) Possession of tenant and access by landlord. Until the expiration date specified in the lease, or the termination of a periodic tenancy or tenancy at will, and so long as the tenant is not default, the tenant has the right to exclusive possession of the premises, except as hereafter provided. The landlord may upon advance notice and at reasonable times inspect the premises, make repairs and show the premises to prospective tenants or purchasers; and if the tenant is absent from the premises and the landlord reasonably believes that the entry is necessary to preserve or protect the premises, the landlord may enter without notice and with such force as appears necessary. (c) Use of premises, additions or alterations by tenant. The tenant can make no physical changes in the nature of the premises, including decorating, removing, altering or adding to the structures thereon, without prior consent of the landlord. The tenant cannot use the premises for any unlawful purpose nor in such a manner as to interfere unreasonably with use by another occupant of the same building or group of buildings. (d) Tenant's Fixtures. At the termination of the tenancy, the tenant may remove any fixtures installed by him if he either restores the premises to their condition prior to the installation or pays to the landlord the cost of such restoration. Where such fixtures were installed to replace similar fixtures which were part of the premises at the time of the commencement of the tenancy, and the original fixtures cannot be restored the tenant may remove fixtures installed by him only if he replaces them with fixtures at least comparable in condition and value to the original fixtures. The tenant's right to remove fixtures is not lost by an extension or renewal of a lease without reservation of such right to remove. This subsection applies to any fixtures added by the tenant for his convenience as well as those added for purposes of trade, agriculture or business; but this subsection does not govern the rights of parties other than the landlord and tenant. (e) Storage or disposition of personalty left by tenant. (1) If a tenant removes from the premises and leaves personal property of an apparent total value of less than $100, the landlord may: (A) Store such personalty, with or without notice to the tenant, on or off the premises, with a lien on the personalty for actual cost of removal and storage or, if stored by the landlord, for the reasonable value of storage; (B) Give the tenant notice, personally or by ordinary mail addressed to the tenant at his last-known address, of the landlord's intent to dispose of the personalty by sale or other appropriate means if the property is not repossessed by the tenant within 5 days of such personal service or 8 days of the date of mailing. If the tenant fails to repossess within the time specified, the landlord may proceed to dispose of such property by private or public sale or any other appropriate means. The landlord may deduct from the proceeds of sale any costs of sale and any storage charges if he has first stored the personalty under sub d. A, and send the balance of the proceeds to the tenant by registered mail addressed to his last known address; if such proceeds are returned to the landlord and are not claimed within five months after the date on which they were mailed, the proceeds shall belong to the landlord. (2) Rights of third persons. The landlord's lien and power to dispose as provided by this subsection apply to any property left on the premises by the tenant, whether owned by him or by others. Such lien has priority over any ownership or security interest and the power to dispose under this subsection applies notwithstanding rights of others existing under any claim of ownership or security interest. Notice of intended disposition need to be given only to the tenant. The tenant or any secured party shall have the right to redeem the property at any time before the landlord has disposed of it or entered into a contract for its disposition by payment of the landlord's charges for removal, storage, disposition, arranging for the sale and reasonable attorney's fees and legal expenses. (3) Other procedure. The remedies of this subsection are not exclusive and shall not prevent the landlord from resorting to any other available judicial procedure.

An agreement to waive the requirements of this section is void. Nothing in this section is intended to affect rights and duties arising under other law. (b) Duty of Landlord. (1) Unless the repair was made necessary by the negligence or improper use of the premises by the tenant, the landlord is under a duty to: (A) Keep in a reasonable state of repair portions of the premises over which he maintains control; (B) Keep in a reasonable state of repair all equipment under his control necessary to supply services which he has expressly or implied agreed to furnish to the tenant, such as heat, water, elevator or air-conditioning. (C) Make all necessary structural repairs; (D) Repair or replace any plumbing, electrical wiring, machinery or equipment furnished with the premises and no longer in reasonable working condition, except as provided in sub. (c)(2). (E) Comply with applicable housing code. (2) If the premises are part of a building, other parts of which are occupied by one or more other tenants, negligence or improper use by one tenant does not relieve the landlord from his duty as to the other tenants to make repairs as provided in par. (1). (3) If the premises are damaged by fire, water or other casualty, not the result of the negligence or intentional act of the landlord, this subsection is inapplicable and either sub. (2) or (d) governs. (c) Duty of Tenant. (1) If the premises are damaged by the negligence or improper use of the premises by the tenant, the tenant must repair the damage and restore the appearance of the premises by redecorating. However, the landlord may elect to undertake the repair or redecoration, and in such case the tenant must reimburse the landlord for the reasonable cost thereof; the cost to the landlord is presumed reasonable unless proved otherwise by the tenant. (2) The tenant is also under a duty to keep plumbing, electrical wiring, machinery and equipment furnished with the premises in reasonable working order if repair can be made at cost which is minor in relation to the rent. (3) A tenant shall comply with an applicable housing code. (d) Untenantability. If the premises becomes untenantable because of damage by fire, water or other casualty or because of any condition hazardous to health, or if there is a substantial violation of sub. (b) materially affecting the health or safety of the tenant, the tenant may remove from the premises unless the landlord proceeds promptly to repair or rebuild or eliminate the health hazard or the substantial violation of sub. (b) materially affecting the health or safety of the tenant; or the tenant may remove if the inconvenience to the tenant by reason of the nature and period of repair, rebuilding or elimination would impose undue hardship on him. If the tenant remains in possession, rent abates to the extent the tenant is deprived of the full normal use of the premises. This section does not authorize rent to be withheld in full, if the tenant remains in possession. If the tenant justifiably moves out under this subsection, the tenant is not liable for rent after the premises become untenantable and the landlord must repay any rent paid in advance apportioned to the period after the premises become untenantable. This subsection is inapplicable if the damage or condition is caused by negligence or improper use by the tenant.

(b) Effect of transfer on liability or transferor. In the absence of an express release or a contrary provision in the lease, transfer or consent to transfer does not relieve the transferring party of his contractual obligations under the lease, except in the special situation governed by Section. 124.16(e). (c) Covenants Which Apply to Transferee. All covenants and provisions in a lease which are not either expressly or by necessary implication personal to the original parties are enforceable by or against the successors in interest of any party to the lease. However, a successor in interest is liable in damages, or entitled to recover damages, only for a breach which occurs during the period when such successor holds his interest, unless he has by contract assumed greater liability; a personal representative may also recover damages for a breach for which his decedent could have recovered. (d) Same Procedural Remedies. The remedies available between the original landlord and tenant are also available to or against any successor in interest to either party. (e) Consent as Affecting Subsequent Transfers. If a lease restricts transfer, consent to a transfer or waiver of a breach of the restriction is not a consent or waiver as to any subsequent transfers.

If a tenant holds over after expiration of a lease, the landlord may in every proceed in any manner permitted by law to remove the tenant and recover damages for such holding over. (b) Creation of periodic tenancy by holding over. (1) Nonresidential leases for a year or longer. If premises leased for a year or longer primarily for other than private residential purposes, and the tenant hold over after expiration of the lease, the landlord may elect to hold the tenant on a month-to-month basis; but if such lease provides for a weekly or daily rent, the landlord may hold the tenant only on the periodic basis on which rent is computed. (2) All other leases. If premises are leased for less than a year for any use, or if leased for any period primarily for private residential purposes, and the tenant holds over after expiration of the lease, the landlord may elect to hold the tenant on a month-to-month basis; but if such lease provides for a weekly or daily rent, the landlord may hold the tenant only on the periodic basis on which rent is computed. (3) When election takes place. Acceptance of rent for any period after expiration of a lease, the landlord may elect to hold the tenant on a month-to-month basis; but if such lease provides for a weekly or daily rent, the landlord may hold the tenant for a weekly or daily rent, the landlord may hold the tenant only on the periodic basis on which rent is computed. (c) Terms of tenancy created by holding over. A periodic tenancy arising under this section is upon the same terms and conditions as those of the original lease except that any right of the tenant to renew or extend the lease, or to purchase the premises, or any restriction on the power of the landlord to sell without first offering to sell the premises to the tenant, does not carry over to such a tenancy. (d) Effect of contrary agreement. This section governs except as the parties agree otherwise either by the terms of the lease itself or by an agreement at any subsequent time. (e) Holdover by assignee or subtenant. If an assignee or subtenant holds over after the expiration of the lease, the landlord may either elect to: (1) Hold the assignee or subtenant or, if he or she participated in the holding over, the original tenant as a periodic tenant under sub.

In absence of proof of greater damages, the landlord may recover as minimum damages twice the rental value apportioned on a daily basis for the time the tenant remains in possession. As used in this section, rental value means the amount for which the premises might reasonably have been rented, but not less than the amount actually paid or payable by the tenant for the prior rental period, and includes the money equivalent of any obligations undertaken by the tenant as part of the rental agreement, such as payment of taxes, insurance and repairs.

{"body": "Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa Indians Tribal Code. 1.24.180 Recovery of Rent and Damages by Landlord; Mitigation (a) Scope of section. If a tenant unjustifiably removes from the premises prior to the effective date for termination of his tenancy and defaults in payment of rent, or if the tenant is removed for failure to pay rent or any other breach of a lease, the landlord can recover rent and damages except amounts which he could mitigate in accordance with this section, unless he has expressly agreed to accept a surrender of the premises and end the tenant's liability. Except as the context may indicate otherwise, this section applies to the liability of a tenant under a lease, a periodic tenant, or an assignee of either. (b) Measure of recovery. In any claim against a tenant for rent and damages, or for either, the amount of recovery is reduced by the net rent obtainable by reasonable efforts to re- rent the premises. Reasonable efforts mean those steps which the landlord would have taken to rent the premises if they had been vacated in due course, provided that such steps are in accordance with local rental practice for similar properties. In the absence of proof that greater net rent is obtainable by reasonable efforts to re-rent the premises, the tenant is credited with rent actually received under a re-rental agreement minus expenses incurred as a reasonable incident of acts under sub. (d), including a fair proportion of any cost of remodeling or other capital improvements. In any case the landlord can recover, in addition to rent other elements of damage, all reasonable expenses of listing and advertising incurred in re-renting and attempting to re-rent (except as taken into account in computing the net rent under preceding sentence). If the landlord has used the premises as part of reasonable efforts to re-rent, under sub.(4)(c), the tenant is credited with the reasonable value of the use of the premises, which is presumed to be equal to the rent recoverable from the defendant unless the landlord proves otherwise. If the landlord has other similar premises for rent and receives an offer from a prospective tenant not obtained by the defendant, it is reasonable for the landlord to rent the other premises for his own account in preference to those vacated by the defaulting tenant. (c) Burden of proof. The landlord must allege and prove that he has made efforts to comply with this section. The tenant has the burden of proving that the efforts of the landlord were not reasonable, that the landlord's refusal of any offer to rent the premises or a part thereof was not reasonable, that any terms and conditions upon which the landlord has in fact re-rented were not reasonable, and that any temporary use by the landlord was not part of reasonable efforts to mitigate in accordance with sub. (d)(3); the tenant also has the burden of proving the amount that could have been obtained by reasonable efforts to mitigate by rerenting. (d) Acts privileged in mitigation of rent or damages. The following acts by the landlord do not defeat his right to recover rent and damages and do not constitute an acceptance of surrender of the premises: (1) Entry, with or without notice, for the purpose of inspecting, preserving, repairing, remodeling and showing the premises; (2) Re-renting the premises or a part thereof, with or without notice, with rent applied against the damages caused by the original tenant and in reduction of rent accruing under the original lease; (3) Use of the premises by the landlord until such time as re-renting at a reasonable rent is practical, not to exceed one year, if the landlord gives prompt written notice to the tenant that the landlord is using the premises pursuant to this section and that he will credit the tenant with the reasonable value of the use of the premises to the landlord for such a period; (4) Any other act which is reasonably subject to interpretation as being in mitigation of rent or damages and which does not unequivocally demonstrate an intent to release the defaulting tenant.

{"body": "Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa Indians Tribal Code. 1.25.010 Purpose Children are the most important asset of the Bad River Tribe. In them lie the Tribe's future, and in their retention of Chippewa culture lies the preservation of the Tribe's past. Their health, safety, and welfare are paramount to the Tribe. It is the policy of the Tribe to strengthen family structures, to prevent family breakups, and to foster conditions favorable to the growth, spirit, culture, and individuality of each child. A child without knowledge of the past is directionless in the path forward; a child without a nurturing present is denied the strengths that lead to the future. It is the Tribe's policy to favor preventive action over belated reaction, mediation over confrontation, counseling over lecturing, conciliation over punishment - but in all decisions made under this code the welfare of the child shall be the ultimate touchstone.

(b) Termination of parental rights may be ordered only in a proceeding where the petition clearly states that the petitioner is seeking an order of termination of parental rights, and where the mother and father have been summoned to appear before the Children's Court. No termination of the parental rights of an unadjudicated or unacknowledged father may be ordered without evidence and findings as to paternity of the child to the satisfaction of the court. (c) Suspension of Parental Rights means that pursuant to court order, all rights, powers, privileges, immunities, duties, and obligations existing between parent and child are suspended as agreed by biological parent; however tribal membership, rights, privileges, entitlements, or obligations shall not be affected by such suspension for the child(ren). (d) Involuntary Termination. Termination of parental rights may be ordered only in cases where the court finds that one or more of the following grounds exists: (1) Abandonment. (A) The child has been left without provision for care or support and without reasonable expectation that a relative or other person would care for and support the child, and the petitioner has investigated and cannot locate the parent, or (B) The child has been left by the parent with a relative or other person, or could reasonably expect that a relative or other person would provide for the child's care and support, or the child has been placed outside the parent's home by the order of a court of competent jurisdiction issued in a proceeding whereby the parent received either an oral or written warning that their parental rights may be terminated in subsequent proceedings, and in either case that the parent has failed to visit or communicate with the child for one year or longer, and that ninety days prior to the filing of the petition for termination of parental rights the parent was notified in a written notice to the parent's last known address that a petition would be filed; or (2) Failure to remedy condition. The child has been under the jurisdiction of court or courts of competent jurisdiction for at least one year and the parent has made no progress in remedying the conditions requiring jurisdiction or the child has been under the jurisdiction of court or courts of competent jurisdiction for at least two years and it is unlikely that the parent will remedy the conditions requiring jurisdiction, and in either case that at least ninety days prior to the filing of a termination of parental rights petition that parent was warned that a petition would be filed; or (3) Abuse. The child is under the jurisdiction of the court pursuant to Section 1.25.060(a)(1) and the Court finds that the facts establishing jurisdiction show a pattern of repeated or severe abuse; or (4) Continuing denial of periods of physical placement. The parent has been denied all periods of physical placement or visitation rights by a court or courts of competent jurisdiction for a period of at least one year, the parent has been warned at least ninety days prior to the filing of a petition that a petition would be filed, and there is no currently pending action to modify the parent's physical placement or visitation rights in a court of competent jurisdiction. (5) Failure to assume parental responsibility. The child is a non-marital child whose father has not subsequently adopted the child or married the child's mother and who has not established a substantial parental relationship with the child, meaning the acceptance and exercise of significant responsibilities for the daily supervision, education, protection, and care of the child, as evidenced by factors including but not limited to whether the father has ever expressed concern for or interest in the support, care, or well-being of the child or mother, and whether the father has neglected or refused to provide support. (e) Voluntary Termination. The court may terminate the parental rights of a parent who has given his or her informed, voluntary consent as provided in this section. (1) The parent appears personally at a hearing and gives his or her consent, the court explains the effect of a termination of parental rights, and the court has questioned the parent and found to its satisfaction that the consent is informed and voluntary. (2) If the personal appearance of the parent before the court would be impossible or difficult, the court may accept written consent executed by the parent before an embassy or consular official, a military judge, or any judge of a court of record of another jurisdiction, and the consent is accompanied by the official's or judge's written findings that the parent was questioned and that the consent is informed and voluntary. (3) A person who may be but has not been adjudicated the father of a non marital child may consent as in (1) or (2) by signing a written, notarized statement that he has been informed of and understands the effect of a termination of parental rights and voluntarily disclaims any rights he may have to the child, including the right of notice of further proceedings under this chapter . (4) If the proceeding to terminate parental rights is held prior to an adoption proceeding in which the petitioner is the child's stepparent, the parent may consent to termination of rights as provided in (1) or (2) or by filing with the court an affidavit witnessed by two persons stating that he or she has been informed of and understands the effect of an order to terminate parental rights, and that he or she voluntarily disclaims all rights to the child, including the right to notice of further proceedings under this chapter . (5) Any minor parent stating an intent to consent to the termination of parental rights shall have a guardian ad litem appointed for him or her by the court. The minor parent's consent to terminate rights shall not be accepted unless joined by his or her guardian ad litem. The consent of the guardian ad litem shall preclude later attack on the validity of the consent on the grounds of incompetence or minority. (f) Petition. (1) A petition for termination of parental rights may only be filed by a child's parent or by the child welfare coordinator. (2) The petition commencing a proceeding for termination of parental rights shall set forth the following facts: (A) The name, birth date, and address of the child or children.

The person shall also be informed that he or she has right to remain silent and that the examiner is required to report to the court even if the person remains silent. The issuance of such a warning to the person prior to each examination establishes a presumption that the person understands that he or she need not speak to the examiner. (b) (1) (A) The proposed ward has the right to counsel whether or not present at the hearing on determination of competency. The court shall in all cases require the appointment of a guardian ad litem or if, at least 72 hours before the hearing, the alleged incompetent requests; the guardian ad litem or any other person states that the alleged incompetent is opposed to the guardianship petition; or the court determines that the interests of justice require it. The proposed ward has the right to a trial by a jury if demanded by the proposed ward, attorney or guardian ad litem, except if notice of the time set for the hearing has previously been provided to the proposed ward and his or her counsel, a jury trial is deemed waived unless demanded at least 48 hours prior to the time set for the hearing.

(b). (2) In any case where the court finds that the person is not competent to refuse psychotropic medication and appoints a guardian to consent to or refuse psychotropic medication on behalf of the person, the court shall do all of the following: (A) Order the appropriate mental health professional to develop or furnish, to provide to the ward, and to submit to the court, a treatment plan specifying the protective services, including psychotropic medication as ordered by the treating physician, that the proposed ward should receive.

(1) The Bad River Tribal Council Tribal Council finds that probate procedure in the Bad River Tribal Court is in the best interest of Tribal members in that probate may be concluded more economically and more expeditiously in the Bad River Tribal Court by other jurisdictions. (2) Furthermore, the determination of how property is disposed upon a person's passing is an exercise of self-governance crucial to the Band's sovereignty. (b) Purpose. This Probate Code will provide for the exercise of the greatest possible Tribal jurisdiction over probate of the estate of decedents who were domiciled or owned real or personal property on the Bad River Reservation. (c) Objectives. This Code shall be liberally construed and applied to meet the following objectives: (1) To ensure that the property of decedents passes to the rightful heirs or beneficiaries. (2) To comply with the decedent's wishes as much as possible. (3) To comply with tribal custom and tradition. (4) To provide a simple, efficient and inexpensive method for probating decedent's property. (5) To prevent the transfer of land out of Tribal ownership and control. (6) To ensure that the rights of creditors of decedents are protected to the extent possible and fair. (7) To promote and further the Band's inherent right of self-governance.

(a) \"Abatement\" means a reduction or decrease. (b) \"Administrator\" means the person appointed by the Band's Trial Court to administer the estate of a decedent according to this Probate Code and may include the Executor named in the decedent's will, appointed at the request of an interested party, appointed by the Court, or the public Administrator. (c) \"Adoption\" means the legal process pursuant to statute in which a child's legal rights and duties toward his or her natural parents are terminated and similar rights and duties toward his or her adoptive parents are substituted. To take into one's family the child of another and give him or her, the rights, privileges, and duties of a child and heir. An adopted person is the child of an adopting parent and of the natural parents for inheritance purposes only. The adoption of a child by the spouse of a natural parent has no effect on the relationship between the child and that natural parent. This legal definition of adoption does not include the customary adoption traditionally practiced by members of the Band. (d) \"Beneficiary\" means any person nominated in a will to receive an interest in property other than in a fiduciary capacity. (e) \"Bond\" means an obligation to pay a sum of money upon the happening of a stated event.

(g) \"Codicil\" means a supplement or an addition to a will; it may explain, modify, add to, subtract from, qualify, alter, restrain or revoke provisions in an existing will. A codicil does not purport to dispose of the entire estate or to contain the entire will of the testator, nor does it ordinarily expressly or by implication revoke an entire prior will. (h) \"Conveyance\" means the transfer of legal title to property from one person, or a class of person, to another person by deed. This term may also include assignment, lease, Bad River mortgage or encumbrance of land. (i) \"Court\" means the Trial Court of the Bad River Band. (j) \"Decedent\" means a person who has passed leaving property that is subject to administration. (k) \"Deed\" means a conveyance of realty by a writing signed by a grantor, whereby title to realty is transferred from one at another. (l) \"Devise\" means a gift of real property by will.

{"body": "Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa Indians Tribal Code. 1.32.260 Rules of Construction and Intention (a) The intention of a testator as expressed in the testator's will controls the legal effect of the testator's dispositions. (b) The Following rules of construction apply unless a contrary intent is clear in the will. (1) All Property and After-acquired Property. A will is construed to pass all property which the testator owns at his or her passing including property acquired after the execution of his or her will. (2) Devisee Must Survive Testator by 120 Hours. A devisee who does not survive the testator by 120 hours is treated as if they predeceased the testator, unless the will of the decedent contains such language dealing explicitly with simultaneous passings, including common disaster, or requiring that the devisee survive the testator or survive the testator for a stated period in order to take under the will. (3) Failure of Testamentary Provision. If a devise other than a residuary devise fails for any reason, it becomes part of the residual estate. If the residual estate is devised to two or more persons and the share of one of the residuary devises fails for any reason, his or her share passes to the other residuary devisees, or to other residuary devises in proportion to his or her interests in the residue. (4) Class Gifts. One who would have been a devise under a class gift if they had survived the testator is treated as a devisee for purposes of this section whether his or her passing occurred before of after the execution of the will. (5) Exercise of Power of Appointment. A general residuary clause in a will, or a will making general disposition of all of the testator's property, does not exercise a power of appointment unless specific reference is made to that power. (6) Generic Terms. Half-bloods, adopted persons and persons born out of wedlock are included in class gifts terminology and terms of relationships in accordance with rules for determining relationships for purposes of intestate succession, but a person born out of wedlock is not treated as the child of the father unless the person is openly and notoriously so treated by the father or unless paternity has been judicially determined during the life of the father or in some other manner which satisfies the court by clear and convincing evidence that paternity has been conclusively established. (7) Ademption by Satisfaction. Property which a testator gave in his or her lifetime to a person is treated as a satisfaction of a devise to that person in whole or in part, only if the will provides for deduction of the lifetime gift, or the testator declares in a contemporaneous writing that the gift is to be deducted from the devise or is in satisfaction. For the purpose of partial satisfaction, property given during the lifetime is valued as of the time the devisee came into possession or enjoyment of the property or as of the time of passing of the testator, whichever occurs first.

{"body": "Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa Indians Tribal Code. 3.11.020 Findings The Bad River Tribal Council finds that wetlands and watercourses are fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands provide important tribal/public benefits and ecological functions. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation, water quality maintenance and pollution control, flood control, shoreline erosion control, natural resource education, scientific study, open space, recreation opportunities, environmental niches, and most importantly the traditional, cultural, and spiritual aspects of our heritage. Previous construction, land development, and other impacts have displaced, polluted, or degraded many wetlands and forested flood plains. Piecemeal or cumulative losses continue to threaten the remaining wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens the public safety, health and general welfare of the Band. Preservation of the wetlands in a natural condition is necessary to maintain hydrologic, economic, recreational, subsistence, cultural, spiritual and aesthetic assets for current and future residents of the Bad River Reservation. It is therefore necessary for the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians (Bad River Tribe) to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities in wetlands and activities at adjacent upland sites that may adversely affect wetlands, ( 12-16-09-138 .)

{"body": "Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa Indians Tribal Code. 3.11.030 Purposes It is the policy of the Bad River Tribe to require planning to avoid or minimize damage to wetlands; to require that activities not dependent upon wetland location be located at upland sites; to allow wetland losses only where all practical measures to avoid and minimize have been applied; to reduce losses from activities that are unavoidable and in the public interest; and to provide for the protection of wetlands under existing and additional ordinances adopted by the Tribe including management regulations, storm water management regulations, floodplain zoning; and to establish standards and procedures for the review and regulation of the use of wetlands and watercourses and the establishment of penalties for the violation of this ordinance. Furthermore, such development activities shall not threaten Tribal or public safety or cause nuisances by: (a) Restricting flood flows, destroying flood storage areas, or destroying storm barriers, thereby raising flood heights or velocities on other land and increasing flood damages; (b) Causing water pollution through any means including location of wastewater disposal systems in wet soil; unauthorized application of pesticides, and herbicides; disposal of solid wastes or storm water runoff at inappropriate sites; or the creation of unstabilized fills; (c) Increasing erosion; or (d) Increasing runoff of sediment and stormwater. In addition, it is the policy of the Bad River Tribe that activities in or affecting wetlands do not destroy natural wetland functions and values important to the general welfare by: (e) Decreasing breeding, spawning, nesting, wintering, feeding, or other critical habitat for any fish or wildlife, including rare, threatened, and endangered plant and animal species and commercially and recreationally important wildlife; (f) Interfering with the exchange of nutrients needed by fish and other forms of wildlife; (g) Decreasing groundwater recharge; (h) Destroying sites needed for education and scientific research; (i) Interfering with Tribal rights for hunting, fishing, trapping, ricing, and cultural and ceremonial/spiritual uses; (j) Interfering with other activities such as; boating, hiking, birdwatching, photography, and camping; and (k) Destroying aesthetic and property values.

(b) In determining whether the activity is in the Tribal interest, the benefit which would reasonably be expected to accrue from the proposal shall be balanced against the reasonable foreseeable detriments of the activity, taking into consideration the tribal, local, state and national concern for the protection and preservation of natural resources from pollution, impairment and/or destruction. The following general factors and criteria shall be considered: (1) The activity is water-dependent or requires access to the wetland as a central element of its basic function, or is not water-dependent but has no practical upland-only alternative; (2) The availability of feasible and prudent alternative methods and location, other than the project as-proposed, to achieve the expected benefits from the activity; (3) The extent and permanence of the beneficial or detrimental effects which the proposed activity may have on the tribal, public and private use to which the area is suited, including the benefits the protected wetland provides. (4) Tribal, public and private economic value of the proposed land change to the general area; (5) The probable effect on ecological or recreational values and on the public, fish, plant or wildlife health; (6) The probable effect of the proposal in relation to the cumulative effect created by other existing and anticipated activities in the watershed; (7) The probable effect on recognized historic, cultural, and spiritual values; (8) The size and quality of the protected wetland being considered; (9) The amount and quality of remaining wetland in the watershed should the project be implemented; (10) Proximity to any waterway; (11) Extent to which upland soil erosion adjacent to protected wetlands or drainage ways is controlled should the project be implemented; and (12) Findings of necessity for the proposed project which have been made by Tribal Council and/or federal agencies. (c) A permit shall not be granted unless it is shown that: (1) Disturbance of aquatic resources will be avoided then minimized to the extent practicable; (2) The proposed activity is primarily dependent upon being located in the protected wetland; (3) A less damaging feasible alternative does not exist; and (4) The proposed activity will result in the minimum negative effect upon protected wetlands, watercourses, and attendant natural resources, which shall include, but not be limited to: (A) Minimum feasible alteration or impairment to the wetlands functions and existing contour, vegetation, fish and wildlife resources, and hydrological conditions; (B) Critical habitat protection for any species that appears on tribal, federal or State of Wisconsin endangered species lists; (C) Significant degradation of groundwater or surface-water quality; (D) Compliance with all applicable tribal, state, local, and federal laws, including those related to sediment control, pollution control, floodplain zoning, and on- site wastewater disposal; (E) Compliance with other standards contained in the ordinance, including those pertaining to wetland creation, restoration, and preservation as required; and (F) No overall net loss of wetland area or function. (d) A request for a permit in a buffer area for erosion control structures, storm water management facilities, and water-dependent structures shall be approved, provided that the flow of water is not diverted from protected wetlands and that excessive siltation does not occur in the protected wetlands. The use of the buffer area for other permanent structures, earth-moving activities or other uses shall only be approved in accordance with the standards and criteria contained in this Section .

(d) Application Review . Upon receipt of the application the following reviews shall be conducted: (1) Administrative Review: The WRP shall review the application for completeness and accuracy. If the WRP determines that the application is incomplete or inaccurate, or that additional information is required to analyze whether the proposed activity will cause or contribute to a violation of the Tribe's WQS, the WRP shall request the relevant additional or corrected information from the applicant within forty-five (45) days of the receipt of the application. If the WRP determines that the application is complete and accurate, it shall issue a Public Notice for the application for Water Quality Certification (the \"Comment Period\") in accordance with the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa's Administrative Procedure: Notice of Intent to Adopt a Code or Availability of Draft Environmental Review Statement. All comments received by the WRP will be reviewed by the WRP. Comments may be sent to the applicant for a satisfactory response using the contact information provided by the applicant. The applicant shall submit its responses to the comments to the WRP. (2) Technical Review: The WRP will conduct a technical review of the application materials and the applicant's responses to comments to evaluate whether the proposed activity will cause or contribute to a violation of the Tribe's Water Quality Standards (the \"Technical Review\"). If necessary or advisable, the WRP shall inspect lands, waters, or facilities relevant to its technical review of the application materials. (e) Recommendation . At the end of the Technical Review, the WRP will make a Recommendation to the Director regarding the application together with the basis of that recommendation (the \"Recommendation\"). The Recommendation will be either to: (1) grant the Tribal Water Quality Certification unconditionally; (2) grant the Water Quality Certification with such conditions necessary or advisable to ensure compliance with the Tribe's WQS; or (3) deny the Water Quality Certification. The Director will then issue one of the three recommendations to the Tribal Council (the \"Director's Concurrence\"). The Director's Concurrence shall include a statement of the basis for the recommendation. The WRP shall present a copy of the Director's Concurrence to the Tribal Council. (f) Decision . Within thirty (30) days of the Director's Concurrence, the WRP shall present the Recommendation to Tribal Council during a public meeting. Unless the Council asks the WRP for additional information that would take additional time to compile, at this meeting the Council will issue one of three Decisions (the \"Decision\"): (1) grant the Water Quality Certification unconditionally; (2) grant the Water Quality Certification with such conditions necessary or advisable to ensure compliance with Tribe's Water Quality Standards; or (3) deny the Tribal Water Quality Certification. After the Decision is reached, the WRP shall deliver a copy of the Tribal Council's Decision to the EPA, the federal permitting or licensing agency, and the applicant. (g) Timeline . It is anticipated that the comment period, technical review, recommendation, and decision outlined in this this section shall be completed within six (6) months of the receipt of an application (the \"Timeline\"). However: (1) If the applicant needs time to respond to WRP requests for additional or corrected information, or if the applicant does not respond within thirty (30) days to public comments, the six (6) month timeframe shall be extended by an amount equal to the time taken by the applicant for these purposes; (2) If the Tribal Council asks the WRP for further information after the Recommendation has been presented, then the six (6) month timeframe shall be extended by an amount equal to the time needed to gather such information; or (3) If the Tribe will not issue its decision within six (6) months, it shall so notify the EPA, the permitting or licensing agency, and the applicant. Such notification shall state that the Tribe is not waiving its right to make a decision regarding the request for Water Quality Certification and shall provide a revised timeframe for that decision. (h) Reduced Timeline . The WRP shall determine if, and the extent to which, an applicant qualifies for a Reduced Timeline (\"Reduced Timeline\") within five (5) days of receipt of the applicant's application if the applicant includes in its application a proposed reduced time period for the Timeline. The Reduced Timeline may include reducing the time period for the Comment Period as described in Administrative Procedure Section 118.3.a.iii. and for the Applicant Review, Recommendation, and Decision. To qualify for a Reduced Timeline, applicant must demonstrate (1) the applicant has not unduly delayed submitting its application causing a need for a Reduced Timeline, and (2) the need for a Reduced Timeline arises out of at least one of the two following situations: (1) The proposed activity has been mandated by a Tribal or Federal order; or (2) The proposed activity is in response to a Public Emergency and requires immediate authorization to avoid imminent endangerment to human health, public safety, or the environment, or to reestablish essential public services. For activities that qualify under subsection (h)(2) or (h)(3), the applicant may request that the Director, rather than the Tribal Council, make the Decision, and for there to be no Director's Concurrence. In reviewing the proposal for a Reduced Timeline, the WRP or Director will decide to either: (1) adopt the proposed Reduced Timeline provided by the applicant; (2) set a different Reduced Timeline; or (3) not implement a Reduced Timeline. (i) Reapplication Process . If an applicant disagrees with the determination of the Tribal Council, the applicant may reapply for Tribal Water Quality Certification. The applicant may choose to significantly alter the proposed project to avoid, minimize, and/or mitigate for the impacts to water resources that facilitated the Tribal Council's Decision.

{"body": "Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa Indians Tribal Code. 3.13.010 Findings The Tribal Council finds that the fisheries of the Bad River Tribe, both on the reservation and in Lake Superior, constitute important communal resources possessed by the Tribe as a whole. The Bad River Tribe has a long history of lake and river fishing and a long history of respect for the fish its members pursue. Both before and after the treaty era, Bad River members fished for subsistence, consuming some of the fish they caught, and selling, on a subsistence level, others. Tribal members have also fished for market on a commercial scale, and the time is not so far past when commercial fishing wharves lined the Bad River at Old Odanah, home port to member-owned fishing steamers. The Tribe's interests in the fish of the reservation and of the Lake continue to today. Today's interest is to see that the fish populations survive for harvest tomorrow, and into generations yet unseen. The Tribe's interest is also to provide a source of subsistence - for home use consumption and also for small scale market activity - to its members. Finally, the Tribe's interest is to provide a stable, protected source for the livelihood of those of its members who pursue the Lake's fish on a commercial scale. To meet these interests, the Tribe has embarked on a cooperative management program with the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewas and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. It is only through the joint efforts of the three sovereigns with rights in the Lakes' resources that effective regulation and equitable sharing of the resource can be achieved. This chapter is therefore promulgated. ( 1-10-07-13 ; 11-5-86-79 ; 3-20-86-11 ; 3-7-84-59 .)

Appendix C - Calculation of Seasonal Effort Limitations The following formulas will be used to calculate seasonal effort limitations based upon seasonal CPE's and the total number of fish available at the onset of each season. Alternative 1 : Season 1: Available Individual Quota ------------------------------------------- x 1,000 = Season 1 Effort Limitation Season 1 CPE Season 2: Unused effort from season 1 --------------------------- x Season 1 1,000 CPE ------------------------------------------- x 1,000 = Season 2 Effort Limitation Season 2 CPE Season 3: Unused effort from Season 2 --------------------------- x Season 2 1,000 CPE ------------------------------------------- x 1,000 = Season 3 Effort Limitation Season 3 CPE Alternative 2: Season 1+2: Available individual Quota ------------------------------------------- x 1,000 = Season 1 + 2 Effort Limitation Season 1+2 CPE Season 3: Unused effort from Season 1+2 --------------------------- x Season 1+2 CPE ------------------------------------------- x 1,000 = Season 3 Effort Limitation Season 3 CPE Any unused portion of fish reserved for home use under Section 3.13.130 can be reallocated to the commercial component of the fishery no later than August 1. When and if home use fish are reallocated to the commercial fishery, a sum of 100 fish will be retained from the available balance for home use activity during the remainder of the quota year. The following formula will used to calculate effort limitations for utilization of reallocated home use fish. Available balance - 100 ------------------------------------------- x 1,000 = Effort Limitation for Season 3 CPE Reallocated Home Use Fish The effort limitation for reallocated home use fish will then be allocated among individual licensees.

{"body": "Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa Indians Tribal Code. 3.25.070 Powers and Duties of the Department (a) The department may exercise the following powers in addition to any other powers granted by law: (1) Take, or require potentially responsible parties to take immediate action where the department has determined such action is required to protect human health or the environment; (2) Investigate, provide for investigating, or require potentially responsible parties to investigate any releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, including but not limited to inspecting, sampling, or testing to determine the nature extent of any release or threatened release. If there is a reasonable basis to believe that a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance may exist, the department's authorized employees, agents, or contractors may enter upon any property and conduct investigations. The department shall give reasonable notice before entering property unless an emergency prevents such notice. The department may, by subpoena issued pursuant to Chapters 115 and 114.3 of the Bad River Tribal Court Code, require the attendance or testimony of witnesses and the production of documents or other information that the department deems necessary to aid in the investigation of any releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances; (3) Conduct, provide for conducting, or require potentially responsible parties to conduct remedial actions (including investigations under (1) of this subsection) to remedy releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances. In carrying out such powers, the department's authorized employees, agents, or contractors may enter upon property. The department shall give reasonable notice before entering property unless an emergency prevents such notice. In conducting, providing for, or requiring remedial action, the department shall give preference to permanent solutions to the maximum extent practicable and shall provide for or require adequate monitoring to ensure the effectiveness of the remedial action; (4) In addition to those powers described in Section 3.25.070(a)(1) , (2) , and (3) , carry out all Tribal programs authorized under the federal cleanup law, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 42 U. S.C. \u00a7 6901 et seq., as amended, and other federal laws; (5) Classify substances as hazardous substances for purposes of Section 3.25.060(m) of this Chapter ; (6) Issue administrative orders or enter into consent decrees or agreed orders, or issue written opinions under (8) of this subsection that may be conditioned upon, environmental covenants where necessary to protect human health and the environment from a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance from a facility. Prior to establishing an environmental covenant under this subsection, the department shall consult with tribal entities having experience in the subject matter of the order; (7) Enforce the application of permanent and effective institutional controls that are necessary for a remedial action to be protective of human health and the environment and the notification requirements established in Section 3.25.080 of this Chapter , and impose penalties for violations of that section consistent with Section 3.25.090(e) of this Chapter ; (8) Provide informal advice and assistance to persons regarding the administrative and technical requirements of this chapter . This may include site-specific advice to persons who are conducting or otherwise interested in independent remedial actions. Any such advice or assistance shall be advisory only, and shall not be binding on the department. As a part of providing this advice and assistance for independent remedial actions, the department may prepare written opinions regarding whether the independent remedial actions or proposals for those actions meet the substantive requirements of this chapter or whether the department believes further remedial action is necessary at the facility. The department may collect, from persons requesting advice and assistance, the costs incurred by the department in providing such advice and assistance. The Tribe, the department, and officers and employees of the Tribe are immune from all liability, and no cause of action of any nature may arise from any act or omission in providing, or failing to provide, informal advice and assistance. (b) The department shall maintain the hazardous sites list. (1) The department shall give a hazard ranking to sites placed on the list. The purpose of hazard ranking is to estimate, based on the information compiled during the site assessment, the relative potential risk posed by the site to human health and the environment. This assessment considers air, groundwater, and surface water migration pathways, human and nonhuman exposure targets, the presence of threatened or endangered species or habitat, the presence of subsistence crops or resources, tribal uses of the site or surrounding area, historical cultural practices of the site or surrounding area, properties of the substances present, and the interaction of these variables. (2) The department may, at its discretion, re-rank a site if, before the initiation of action at the site, the department receives additional information within the scope of the evaluation criteria which indicates that a significant change in rank may result. (3) Site status. The hazardous sites list shall reflect the current status of remedial action at each site. The department may change a site's status to reflect current conditions. The status for each site shall be identified as one of the following: (A) Sites awaiting further remedial action; (B) Sites with remedial action in progress; (C) Sites where a cleanup action has been conducted but conformational monitoring is underway; or (D) Other categories established by the department. (4) The department may remove a site from the list only after it has determined that (A) all remedial actions except confirmational monitoring have been completed and compliance with the cleanup standards has been achieved at the site; (B) the listing was erroneous. (5) A site owner, operator, or potentially responsible person may request that a site be removed from the list by submitting a petition to the department. The petition shall include thorough documentation of all investigations performed, all cleanup actions taken, and adequate compliance monitoring to demonstrate to the department's satisfaction that one of the conditions in (4) of this subsection has been met. The department may require payment of costs incurred, including an advance deposit, for review and verification of the work performed. The department shall review such petitions; however, the timing of the review shall be at its discretion and as resources may allow. (6) Record of sites. The department shall maintain a record of sites that have been removed from the list under subsection (4) of this section . (7) Relisting of sites. The department may relist a site that has previously been removed if it determines that the site requires further remedial action. ( 4-1-15-399 .)

(a) Procedures for consent decrees initiated by the department. When the department believes that a consent decree will be a more expeditious method to achieve remedial action at a facility, it may initiate the procedures set forth in this subsection by sending a letter to the potentially responsible person. The letter shall be sent via certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal service. (1) The letter shall: (A) Inform potentially responsible person(s) that the department wants to begin negotiations which may lead to a consent decree providing for remedial action; (B) Propose a draft consent decree and scope of work; (C) Define the negotiation process and schedule which shall not exceed ninety days; (D) Reference the department's finding under Section 3.25.070(a)(8) of this Chapter regarding whether the remedial actions or proposals for those actions meet the substantive requirements of this chapter or whether the department believes further remedial action is necessary at the facility; (E) Request a written statement of the potentially responsible person's willingness to proceed with the negotiation process defined in the letter; and (F) Request the names of other persons whom the person has reason to believe may be potentially responsible persons at the facility. (2) The letter may request the potentially responsible person to respond, in writing, to the proposed draft consent decree and scope of work before beginning the negotiation phase. (3) Negotiations. The department, with the assistance of the office of the Tribal Attorney, shall negotiate with potentially responsible persons who have indicated to the department a willingness to proceed with the negotiations. The negotiation time frame shall begin from the date the potentially responsible person receives the letter under (1) of this subsection unless modified by the department. Negotiations may address one or more phases of remedial action. (4) Enforcement stay. Unless an emergency exists, the department will stay any enforcement action under Section 3.25.090 of this Chapter , but the duration of the stay shall not exceed ninety days from the date negotiations begin. The department can withdraw from negotiations if it determines that: (A) Reasonable progress is not being made toward a consent decree acceptable to the department; or (B) The proposal is inappropriate based on new information or changed circumstances. The department may commence with enforcement action after notifying the potentially liable person, in writing, of its intent to withdraw from negotiations. (5) Deadline extensions. The department may, at its discretion, extend the deadline for negotiations established in (3) of this subsection, provided the extension does not exceed thirty days. (b) Procedures for consent decrees initiated by potentially responsible persons.

(3) Recognizing that the steps of the cleanup process may be combined and may vary by site, the information in the request shall be at the level of detail appropriate to the steps in the process for which the consent decree is requested. For example, a request for a consent decree for a remedial investigation/feasibility study should generally include the level of information needed for a site hazard assessment, if not already done by the department, so that the department can evaluate the proposed scope of work and relative priority of the site. (4) The department may waive part of the letter requirements of (1) of this subsection if the requirements have already been met. (5) Response. The department shall respond to the request within sixty days, unless the department needs additional time. The department may: (A) Request additional information; (B) Accept the request and require the person to submit a detailed written proposal by a specified date; or (C) Provide written reasons for denying the request.

The department, with the assistance of the Tribal Attorney, shall then negotiate with those potentially responsible persons who have received a notice under (7) of this subsection that their proposal was sufficient to proceed with negotiations. Negotiations may address one or more phases of remedial action. (9) Enforcement stay. Unless an emergency exists, the department will stay any enforcement action under Section 3.25.090 of this Chapter , but the duration of such stay shall not exceed one hundred twenty days from the date negotiations begin. The department can withdraw from negotiations if it determines that: (A) Reasonable progress is not being made toward a consent decree acceptable to the department; or (B) The proposal is inappropriate based on new information or changed circumstances. The department may begin an enforcement action after notifying the potentially liable person, in writing, of its intent to withdraw from negotiations. (c) Filing a decree. The department shall determine whether the proposed settlement negotiated under subsection (a) or (b) of this section , is more expeditious and consistent with cleanup standards established and in compliance with any order issued by the department relevant to the remedial action. The department shall forward the proposed consent decree to the office of the Tribal Attorney. If agreed to by the Tribal Attorney, the consent decree will be filed by that office with the tribal court. ( 4-1-15-399 .)

{"body": "Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa Indians Tribal Code. 3.25.110 Agreed Orders (a) Purpose. Agreed orders may be used for all remedial actions. An agreed order means that the potentially responsible person agrees to perform remedial actions at the site in accordance with the provisions of the agreed order and that the department will not take additional enforcement action against the potentially responsible person to require those remedial actions specified in the agreed order so long as the potentially responsible person complies with the provisions of the order. Since an agreed order is not a settlement, an agreed order shall not provide a covenant not to sue, or protection from claims for contribution. The department may require additional remedial actions should it deem such actions necessary. (b) Procedures for agreed orders initiated by a potentially responsible person. (1) To request an agreed order, a person shall submit a letter to the department based on available information, describing: (A) The proposed remedial action including a schedule for the work; (B) The facility, including location and boundaries; (C) The environmental problems to be addressed, including the releases at the facility and the potential impact of those releases to human health and the environment; (D) A summary of the relevant historical use or conditions at the facility; and (E) Names of other persons whom the person has reason to believe may be potentially responsible persons at the facility. (2) Recognizing that the basic steps of the cleanup process may be combined and may vary by site, the information in the request shall be at the level of detail appropriate to the step in the process for which the order is requested. For example, a request for an agreed order for a remedial investigation/feasibility study should generally include the level of information needed for a site hazard assessment, so that the department and the public can evaluate the proposed scope of work and relative priority of the site. (3) The department may waive part of the letter requirements of (1) of this subsection if the requirements have already been met. (c) Department response to potentially responsible party-initiated request. The department shall respond to the request within sixty days, unless the department needs additional time. The department may: (1) Request additional information; (2) Proceed with discussions, if the department believes it is in the public interest to do so; or (c) Provide written reasons for denying the request. (d) Procedures for agreed orders initiated by the department. When the department believes that an agreed order is an appropriate method to achieve remedial action at a facility, it may initiate the request for an agreed order. (e) Duration of discussions. Discussions on the agreed order shall not exceed sixty days unless the department decides continued discussions are in the public interest. (f) Enforcement. Unless an emergency exists, the department will stay any enforcement action under Section 3.25.090 of this Chapter ; however, the duration of such stay shall not exceed sixty days from the date discussions begin. Furthermore, the department can withdraw from discussions if it determines that: (1) Reasonable progress is not being made toward an agreed order acceptable to the department; or (2) The agreed order is inappropriate based on new information or changed circumstances. The department may begin an enforcement action after notifying the potentially responsible person in writing of its intent to withdraw from discussions. (g) Focus of discussions. The focus of discussions for the agreed order shall ordinarily be the technical scope of work and work schedule. This subsection is not intended to preclude discussion on any item. It is intended to convey the expectation that the scope of work and work schedule will be the primary topics of discussion in developing agreed orders. ( 4-1-15-399 .)

This subsection (c)(2) is limited as follows: (A) To establish that a person had no reason to know, the person must have undertaken, at the time of acquisition, all appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property, consistent with good commercial or customary practice, in an effort to minimize liability. Any court interpreting this subsection (c)(2) shall take into account any specialized knowledge or experience on the part of the person, the relationship of the purchase price to the value of the property, if uncontaminated, commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property, the obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect such contamination by appropriate inspection; (B) The defense contained in this subsection (c)(2) is not available to any person who had actual knowledge of the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance when the person owned the real property and who subsequently transferred ownership of the property without first disclosing such knowledge to the transferee; (C) The defense contained in this subsection (c)(2) is not available to any person who, by any act or omission, caused or contributed to the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance at the facility; (3) Any natural person who uses a hazardous substance lawfully, and without negligence, for any personal or domestic purpose in or near a dwelling or accessory structure when that person is: (i) A resident of the dwelling; (ii) a person who, without compensation, assists the resident in the use of the substance; or (iii) a person who is employed by the resident, but who is not an independent contractor; or (4) Any person who, for the purpose of growing food crops, applies pesticides or fertilizers without negligence and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations; or (5) The Tribe or a Tribal entity.

(1) The Tribal Attorney may agree to a settlement with any potentially responsible person only if the department finds, after public notice and any required hearing, that the proposed settlement would lead to a more expeditious cleanup of hazardous substances in compliance with clean-up standards under this chapter and with any remedial orders issued by the department. Whenever practicable and in the public interest, the Tribal Attorney may expedite such a settlement with persons whose contribution is determined by the department to be insignificant in amount and toxicity. (2) A settlement agreement under this section shall be entered as a consent decree issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. (3) A settlement agreement may contain a covenant not to sue only of a scope commensurate with the settlement agreement in favor of any person with whom the Tribal Attorney has settled under this section . Any covenant not to sue shall contain a reopener clause which requires the court to amend the covenant not to sue if factors not known at the time of entry of the settlement agreement are discovered and present a previously unknown threat to human health or the environment. (4) A party who has resolved its liability to the department under this section shall not be liable for claims for contribution regarding matters addressed in the settlement. The settlement does not discharge any of the other responsible parties but it reduces the total potential liability of the others to the department by the amount of the settlement. (5) If the department has entered into a consent decree with an owner or operator under this section , the Tribe shall not enforce this chapter against any owner or operator who is a successor in interest to the settling party unless under the terms of the consent decree the tribe could enforce against the settling party, if: (A) The successor owner or operator is liable with respect to the facility solely due to that person's ownership interest or operator status acquired as a successor in interest to the owner or operator with whom the Tribe has entered into a consent decree; and (B) The stay of enforcement under this subsection does not apply if the consent decree was based on circumstances unique to the settling party that do not exist with regard to the successor in interest, such as financial hardship. (6) Any person who is not subject to enforcement by the department under (5) of this subsection is not liable for claims for contribution regarding matters addressed in the settlement. (b) In addition to the settlement authority provided under subsection (a) of this section , the Tribal Attorney may agree to a settlement with a prospective purchaser, provided that: (1) The settlement will yield substantial new resources to facilitate cleanup; (2) The settlement will expedite remedial action at the facility consistent with the rules adopted under this chapter ; and (3) Based on available information, the department determines that the redevelopment or reuse of the facility is not likely to contribute to the existing release or threatened release, interfere with remedial actions that may be needed at the facility, or increase health risks to persons at or in the vicinity of the facility. (c) Nothing in this chapter affects or modifies in any way any person's right to seek or obtain relief under other statutes or under Tribal law or common law, including but not limited to damages for injury or loss resulting from a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance. No settlement by the department or remedial action ordered by a court or the department affects any person's right to obtain a remedy under Tribal law, common law or other statutes. ( 4-1-15-399 .)

{"body": "Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa Indians Tribal Code. 4.02.070 Procedure (a) Application. The administrator shall make lease site application forms available to any tribal member seeking a residential lease. An applicant seeking a residential lease site shall complete an application on the form provided him by the administrator. The applicant may list in order of priority up to three desired lease sites. The applicant shall describe the lease sites as completely as possible and shall include a legal description if available. If necessary for adequate identification the administrator shall make a visit with the applicant to the proposed lease sites. (b) Legal Description. If the applicant is unable to supply a complete legal description of any proposed lease site, the administrator shall request one from the Bureau of Indian Affairs before proceeding further in the certification process for that site. (c) Zoning. The administrator shall check the proposed lease site against the Official Zoning Map, the Official Lease Map, and the Official Forestry Map, and shall verify on the application that the site is tribal property, is not otherwise leased, is within a residential district, is independent of shoreland/wetland restrictions, and is outside the boundaries of any forestry development project. If the site is encroached by shoreland/wetland restrictions but is partially usable for residential site, the administrator shall so note on the application and inform the applicant. The applicant may then choose to have the administrator continue the certification process of the site so encroached, or may request the administrator to proceed with the certification process on an alternate site. (d) Flood Plain. The administrator shall check the proposed site against the Official Flood Map. If the site is within a 100 year flood plain the administrator shall so note on the application and inform the applicant. The applicant may then choose to have the administer continue the certification process of the site or may request the administrator to proceed with the certification process on an alternate site. If the applicant directs the administrator to proceed with the certification process of the flood plain site, the applicant shall sign a statement declaring that he is aware that he will be ineligible for tribal or Indian Health Service assistance in the installation of sewer and water facilities. The site shall not, however, be denied certification solely because it is within a 100 year flood plain. (e) Percolation. The administrator shall refer a site not within a flood plain and meeting the criteria specified in Section 4.02.070(c) to the Indian Health Service to perform a percolation test and to determine the feasibility of locating at the site a private sewer disposal system and well meeting the requirements of Chapter 402. Based on Indian Health Service reports and recommendations the administrator shall determine if the site is suitable for an approved private sewer disposal system and well under Chapter 402. For sites within a flood plain, the applicant shall privately secure and convey to the administrator the information required by this subsection. (f) Certification - Denial. If the proposed site fails to prove suitable under Section 4.02.070(e), the site shall be denied certification, the applicant shall be so informed, and the administrator shall commence the certification process for an alternative site listed on the applicant's application, or shall consult the applicant to determine his wishes. (g) Certification - Granted. If the proposed site is found suitable for a private sewer system and well under Section 4.02.070(e), the administrator shall instruct the Bureau of Indian Affairs to prepare a lease for the site. The lease shall specify the type of private sewer disposal system permitted at the site. (h) Tribal Council Approval. The administrator shall submit to the tribal council for approval the completed lease application, the lease prepared by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and a draft resolution approving the lease.

This Ordinance shall be known as the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians (the \"Band\" or the \"Tribe\") Private On-Site Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Systems Ordinance. (b) Authority. The Bad River Tribal Council is authorized by Article VI of the Bad River Constitution to adopt regulations governing the use and management of the lands and other resources located within the exterior boundaries of the Bad River Reservation as set forth in Article II of the Treaty of 1854, September 30, 1854, 10 Stat. 1109. (c) Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this Ordinance is to develop a Tribal code for individual septic systems and other types of individual wastewater treatment and disposal systems in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the people of the Bad River Reservation and other affected communities by improving the groundwater and surface water quality on the Bad River through regulation of individual wastewater systems and preventing future negative impacts on the groundwater and surface water quality. Furthermore, the development of this Ordinance will help protect wildlife, fish and aquatic organisms in the streams, rivers, lakes and wetlands within the Bad River Reservation. (d) Scope and Date of Applicability. This Ordinance shall govern within the boundaries of the Bad River Reservation and apply immediately upon enactment to any new installation or any renovation of private on-site wastewater treatment and disposal systems (POWTS) and the operation, maintenance, correction and inspection of such systems, as well as holding tanks, engineered systems, experimental systems, privies and other non-plumbing systems. Existing systems shall have one (1) year from the date of enactment of this chapter to come into compliance with its terms evidenced through acquisition of an Inspection Certificate for an adequate system or repair, upgrade, or replacement of a failing or inadequate system. POWTS owners who anticipate not being able to bring their system into compliance within one year of the date of enactment to enter into a compliance schedule agreement with the POWTS Inspector. Systems subject to such a compliance schedule agreement shall have three years from the date of enactment to come into full compliance. (e) Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this Ordinance, its provisions shall be held to be the minimum requirements and shall be construed so as to fully effect its purpose and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other power by law or Ordinance except as specifically provided herein. In the event conflicting requirements are imposed by this Ordinance or by other Ordinances of the Band, the most restrictive provisions shall apply. The POWTS Inspector shall rule on what is more restrictive, and appeals from such decisions, as well as other interpretations, may be made in accordance with Section 4.04.100E herein. (f) Reference and Inclusion of Wisconsin Administrative Code, Department of Commerce and Department of Natural Resources Regulations and Wisconsin Statutes Annotated. Applicable provisions of the Wisconsin Administrative Code (WAC) Department of Commerce Regulations (Comm), including Comm. 83, 84, 85, and 91, and Department of Natural Resources Regulations (NR), and Wisconsin Statutes Annotated (WSA) Section 145, are hereby incorporated into this Ordinance as tribal law. The most recent version of such provisions in effect on the date action is taken pursuant to this Ordinance shall apply. In the event such provisions are no longer the applicable regulations for the State of Wisconsin, this Ordinance shall adopt the regulations then in place for the State of Wisconsin, or, if none exists, the most recent version of such provisions prior to deregulation. Inclusion of WAC and WSA provisions by reference shall not serve to submit the Band or its members to the jurisdiction of the State of Wisconsin. (g) Construction. Words used in the present tense include the past and future tense; the singular includes the plural and the plural includes the singular; the word \"shall\" is mandatory, and the word \"may\" is permissive; the masculine gender includes the feminine gender. (h) Federal Law. Nothing in this Ordinance is intended to modify or supercede requirements of federal law.

{"body": "Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa Indians Tribal Code. 4.05.010 Statement of Policy The Bad River Tribal Council recognizes that the land within its jurisdiction represents a unique confluence of cultural, historical, and environmental resources. Home to the ancestors of the Bad River Band for over three centuries, the land is an irreplaceable habitat for the wealth of fish, waterfowl, and mammal life from which the Chippewa Indians have traditionally derived their sustenance. Where the rivers widen, wild rice stands stretch out to the high ground and down to the Lake, and contribute to a delicate ecosystem about with life. Upstream, the Bad River Falls are the site of pictographs created by the ancestors of those Indians who still fish the Falls today. Throughout the territory traditional burial grounds are scattered, spiritual wellsprings of the Bad River Band and visible reminders of the Band's ancient attachment to the area now known as the Bad River Reservation. Reminders of man's more recent and continuing impact on the land are also visible. Wrought by tribal members and non-members alike, sometimes beneficial to the Bad River Band and sometimes not, sometimes in harmony with the land and sometimes not, these artifacts are lasting mementos of man's presence. Timber sites, roads, utility rights-of-way, government buildings, stores, houses, taverns, motels, hunting shacks, quarries, dumps, mills - all have left a mark of more or less permanence whether appropriately placed and productively used or not. The Bad River Tribal Council, aware of its responsibility to guard for future generations the enjoyment of the resources that so many past generations of Chippewa Indians have enjoyed, is equally aware of increasing pressures on those resources. The demand for wooded and shoreline land is rapidly growing, as greater numbers of the general population seek sites for homes, vacation sites, and commercial development. Meanwhile the Bad River Band seeks an improved economic base to establish the financial security of itself and its members. In limited areas the Band currently has the capability of controlling development. Tribal members have requested leases of tribal land in delicate areas to establish home sites for their families. The Council has denied these leases and by doing so has preserved these lands, to the immediate detriment of some tribal members. The Council cannot, however, control the development of the reservation solely in its capacity as lessor. Regrettably, through the unwise actions of the United States government in previous years, much of the Reservation lands are no longer in tribal hands. Either as restricted allotments or as fee-title land, this property is beyond the proprietary control of the Band. Only through the exercise of the Band's regulatory authority can the majority of Reservation lands be subject to controlled, planned development, to the mutual reciprocal benefit of all. The development of a land use plan, encompassing the 125,000 acres that constitute the Bad River Reservation, cannot spring full-blown overnight. On the other hand, developmental pressures will not cease while the Council deliberates. In order therefore to forestall any action which may limit the Band's regulatory prerogatives, in order to notify those with an interest in any Reservation lands that a comprehensive land use plan is under consideration, in order to establish a process for the creation of such a plan, and in order to establish interim controls pending the approval of such a plan, this ordinance is adopted.

{"body": "Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa Indians Tribal Code. 4.08.010 Purpose (a) The idea of water conservation ordinance focusing on low-flow plumbing fixtures is to encourage water conservation at the tap by requiring all new construction and repair or renovation of existing building to utilize low-flow plumbing fixtures, such as low-flow faucets, washing machines and dishwashers, and toilets. (b) Water quality is of paramount concern to the Tribe. Reduction in water use is necessary to ensure that the Tribe's wastewater treatment facilities are able to function without threat of overload and to prevent overloads of private or individual sewerage systems such as septic systems and holding tanks. Most water coming from the tap goes directly down the drain. Because no distinction can be made between clean, \"gray\" or \"black\" water, all of the water becomes \"black\" and must be treated. Although the water meets strict effluent standards, it is not as \"pure\" as the water originally came out of the tap. The Tribe's wastewater treatment facilities are also limited in the amount of flow they can adequately treat, as are septic systems. Too much water can cause these systems to fail to meet effluent standards. Holding tanks are limited in capacity and must be pumped out. The material pumped out must then be treated in some system. By reducing the amount of water coming out of the faucet, individuals can reduce the amount of clean water entering the waste treatment system, and, consequently, help maintain or improve the quality of the Tribe's water system.

{"body": "Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa Indians Tribal Code. 5.01.130 Classification Criteria (a) Factors to be Considered in Making Classification Determination (1) The critical factors in determining whether a Gaming System is Class II are: (A) Whether the underlying game is a Class II game of Bingo; and (B) Whether the electronic equipment utilized in connection with the game: (i) Is an electronic, computer or other technologic aid, which is permitted within Class II; or (ii) Causes the game to be an electromechanical facsimile of a game of chance. (2) An electronic, computer or other technologic aid: (A) Is defined as electronic, computer, or other technologic equipment used in connection with a game of Bingo that: (i) Assists a player or the playing of a game; (ii) Is not an electromechanical facsimile; and (iii) Is operated in accordance with applicable federal communications law. (B) Includes, but is not limited to, electronic, computer, or other technologic equipment used in connection with a Bingo game that: (i) Broadens participation in the game; (ii) Facilitates communication between and among gaming sites; or (iii) Requires a player to play a game with or against other players rather than with or against a machine. (C) Examples include, but are not limited to, telephones, cables, televisions, screens, satellites, bingo blowers, electronic player stations and electronic Cards. (3) An electromechanical facsimile is a game played in an electronic or electromechanical format that replicates a game of chance by incorporating all of the characteristics of the game, except when for a Class II game such as Bingo, the electronic or electromechanical format broadens participation by allowing multiple players to play with or against each other rather than with or against a machine. (b) Determination that Gaming System is Class II (1) Bingo, as played using a Gaming System, will be determined to be a Class II game if it possesses the attributes of Bingo as set forth in the definition of Bingo in this Regulation. (2) The Tribal Gaming Commission has determined that the following attributes are required by the definition of Bingo: (A) The underlying game consists of: (i) A set quantity of Draw numbers or other designations (hereinafter referred to as \"Symbols\"); (ii) A set number of Cards bearing an array or layout of numbers or other designations available for play in a particular game of Bingo; (iii) Predetermined Game Winning Pattern(s); and (iv) Prizes, including a Game Winning Prize and optional interim and consolation Prizes, as defined under the Rules of Play . (B) The Draw, if conducted using a Random Number Generator, must meet applicable standards for ensuring randomness as set forth in the NIGC Technical Standards or established by the Tribal Gaming Commission. (C) Actual Prize values must be defined before a Prize can be awarded, but need not be defined before the start of a game. (D) A game must be played by a minimum of two players. (3) The Tribal Gaming Commission has determined that the following attributes are consistent with, but not required by , the definition of Bingo: (A) The number of Symbols in a Draw is not fixed; it may be varied from game to game, in accordance with the Rules of Play. Symbols may be displayed, without limitation, as numbers, letters, icons, any other graphic or other enhancement, or any combination thereof. (B) A game may include any number of Cards. The Card may be multi-dimensional. Each Card must have an array or layout of symbols and contain at least two of the Draw symbols. Game Winning Patterns and Prize Winning Patterns can be any configuration of matched symbols on the player's Card. Interim and consolation Prizes also can be awarded for the absence of matched symbols. (C) When playing Bingo, a Draw of a fixed number of Symbols may take place before Cards are purchased by, or distributed to, some or all of the players. Players then compete in a given game by purchasing Cards and then revealing the designations on purchased Cards, so that the pre-drawn Symbols may be Covered. Subsequent Draws may take place to assure that a Game Winning Pattern is achieved. (D) Multiple Prizes may be specified in a game based on, but not necessarily limited to, different Patterns or the number of drawn Symbols required to achieve a specified Pattern. There may be multiple winners, on multiple Cards. Prize levels can also vary for the same Pattern as a function of the player's Consideration for the Card and/or how far the Draw has progressed. Prizes may include interim or consolation Prizes where the Prize is based on the specific order in which the numbers are selected. Progressive Prizes may also be awarded based on specified criteria reflecting sequence or specific characteristics of the Symbols Covered by the player. (E) A player may play more than one Card in a game of Bingo. (4) In determining whether Bingo, as played using a Gaming System, is a Class II game, the Tribal Gaming Commission should not apply any requirements that would: (A) Limit the use of electronic aids to play Bingo, display Cards, Cover Symbols, identify Game or Prize Winning Patterns, or Claim Prizes; (B) Limit the speed of play, Card configuration, or number of Draws in a game; (C) Limit how or when Cards are distributed to players; (D) Limit the sequence of a Draw; (E) Limit how a player Claims a Prize; (F) Limit the type of entertaining display on the Player Interface; or (G) Limit the maximum number of players.

The individual may, in the alternative, demand to be heard at a later scheduled meeting, in which case if the Tribal Council finds in the individual's favor his or her name will be placed on the adoption ballot for the subsequent year. (k) The purpose of this section is to regularize the processing of applications for adoption. It does not confer upon any applicant for adoption any rights or expectation of membership.

II, of the Tribal Constitution , shall be eligible for recommendation for inclusion on an adoption ballot for purposes of enrollment into the Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians. (b) The burden of proof rests upon the applicant to establish his or her eligibility for inclusion on an adoption ballot. Documentary evidence of eligibility includes but is not limited to birth certificates, death certificates, baptismal records, copies of probate findings, affidavits and records of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Committee shall determine the weight and sufficiency of any documentary evidence used to establish eligibility and may require the production of additional evidence if the Committee determines that the evidence submitted is insufficient to establish eligibility. If an applicant fails to respond to the Committee's request for additional evidence within thirty (30) days, the Committee may refuse to recommend that application for approval to the Tribal Council. In addition, where the Committee determines that the documentary evidence provided in support of an application for enrollment is insufficient to establish eligibility for enrollment, the Committee may require an evidentiary hearing on the issue of eligibility. The Enrollment Clerk shall inform the applicant of the need for an evidentiary hearing by written notice, which notice shall also inform the applicant of the date, time and location of the hearing. The applicant may request that the hearing be rescheduled; any such request must be made within two weeks of the applicant's receipt of the notice hearing. The applicant and all witnesses in support of the application for enrollment must appear in person at any such evidentiary hearing. All testimony given shall be sworn. The Committee shall determine the weight and sufficiency of all evidence offered by the applicant to establish eligibility for enrollment and require as evidence of lineal descent that the applicant submit to blood or Deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] testing. DNA testing shall only recognized if performed at a bona fide laboratory employing current standards issued by either the \"Technical Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods\" [TWGDAM] associated with the \"California Association of Criminalist Ad Hoc Committee on DNA Quality Assurance\" or the \"American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors\" [ASCLD]. Applicants shall pay for any and all testing required. Submission of DNA evidence of lineal descent shall occur by the following manner and method: (1) A DNA sample of a known living Bad River tribal member purported to be a blood relative shall be compared to that of the applicant using the Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism [RFLP] method of DNA analysis. Compared subjects may be considered of the same lineal descent of a person appearing on the basic membership roll of the Bad River Tribe, if the compared DNA samples of the applicant and known member are of such similar genotype that the scientific community generally accepts the comparison to be so unique that the applicant is of the direct issue of the known member, i.e., either mother/father and child, or grandmother/grandfather and grandchild, etc. Comparisons which indicate that a known member is a collateral relative such as an aunt, uncle, brother or sister, etc., is not in and of itself evidence of lineal descent from a person appearing on the basic membership roll of the Bad River Tribe. (2) In no case shall a known member be compelled to submit a DNA sample or be otherwise ordered to submit a sample under this ordinance. (3) Notwithstanding DNA evidence submissions, all other requirements of this chapter shall be met when determining eligibility for membership. (c) The applicant shall complete a family tree showing lineal descent from a member whose name appears on the Basic Membership Roll. If the applicant is unable to complete the family tree, the applicant may request the Enrollment Clerk to do so, in which case the applicant shall pay for the actual time and costs incurred by the Enrollment Clerk in completing the family tree. The applicant shall make advance payment of $25.00 with the Enrollment Clerk for the estimated total expenses of completing the family tree, prior to the Enrollment Clerk undertaking any work thereon. The Enrollment Clerk shall keep accurate contemporaneous time and expense records for all work undertaken on each family tree, and shall prepare a regular statement for the applicant thereon. Upon exhaustion of the initial payment, the Enrollment Clerk shall require an additional payment to continue work. (d) Only originals or certified copies of documents submitted as proof of eligibility will be accepted as evidence by the Enrollment Office. (e) The Enrollment Office shall retain all documents that are submitted, unless the applicant requests that the documents be returned to the applicant, in which event a copy of the submitted documents shall be retained by the Enrollment Office. (f) The Tribe shall have sole ownership of all Tribal Membership documents retained by and in the custody of the Committee. (g) Individuals of Indian blood of other tribes, and of no Indian blood, who claim lineal descendancy through a person who has been legally adopted by a lineal descendant, are not eligible for enrollment, except that individuals of Bad River Indian blood shall be eligible for adoption to membership under Article II, Section (4) of the Bad River Constitution . (h) Each applicant shall be required to disclose whether he or she claims descendancy through any person who has been legally adopted. Applicants who so claim must indicate whether their biological descent is of Bad River Chippewa blood, blood of another tribe, or no Indian blood.

{"body": "Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa Indians Tribal Code. 6.01.100 Disenrollment (a) Grounds for Disenrollment. Any tribal member may be disenrolled from membership in the Tribe upon proof of the following; and in accordance with the procedures for disenrollment set forth below: (1) Any person whose membership is based on false material information contained in his or her application, or who withheld material information in making his or her application for enrollment, shall be removed from the membership rolls. (2) Any person whose membership is based on false information given by another person, or whose membership is based on another person's withholding of material information in making the application for enrollment, shall be removed from the rolls. (3) No member may be enrolled in the Tribe who is also enrolled in another tribe. Any member who is alleged to be enrolled in another tribe may be required to furnish proof that he is not so enrolled. Any person who fails to furnish such proof shall be removed from the membership rolls. (b) Disenrollment Proceedings. Disenrollment proceedings shall be governed by the following procedures: (1) Upon receipt of any evidence that a tribal member should be subjected to disenrollment proceedings, the Committee shall discuss the matter at the next scheduled meeting, and shall vote on whether to initiate disenrollment proceedings against such tribal member. No proceeding for disenrollment of a tribal member shall be initiated unless at least four (4) members of the Committee vote to initiate such proceedings. If a majority of the Committee fails to vote in favor of initiating disenrollment proceedings, the matter shall be deemed closed. (2) If the Committee decides to initiate disenrollment proceedings against a tribal member, the Enrollment Clerk shall send a \"Notice of Disenrollment Proceedings\" by certified letter to the last known address of such tribal member. The letter shall specify the grounds for initiating such disenrollment proceedings, and shall explain the disenrollment procedures and the rights and remedies available to the tribal member. The date stamped by the U.S. Post Office on the Domestic Return Receipt shall be deemed to be the date on which the tribal member was served with the \"Notice of Disenrollment Proceedings.\" (3) In the event that the \"\"\"Notice of Disenrollment Proceedings\" is returned undelivered by the United States Post Office, the Enrollment Clerk shall publish the \"Notice of Disenrollment Proceedings\" in the local newspaper in the county of the last known address of the tribal member against whom disenrollment proceedings have been initiated. At the expiration of sixty (60) days from the date such notice first appears in the local newspaper, the tribal member shall be deemed to have been served with the \"Notice of Disenrollment Proceedings.' (4) Any tribal member against whom disenrollment proceedings have been initiated must file a written response challenging such proceedings within thirty (30) days of receipt of the \"Notice of Disenrollment Proceedings.\" Such a response can be mailed by certified or regular mail, and will be deemed filed on the date the response is post-marked by the U.S. Post Office. Failure to file a written response to the \"Notice of Disenrollment Proceedings\" within the thirty day time period shall waive the tribal members rights to an informal hearing before the Committee and a formal hearing before the Tribal Council. (5) Any tribal member against whom disenrollment proceedings have been initiated shall have a right to appear and testify in an informal hearing before the Committee. At such hearing, the Committee shall determine if sufficient evidence exists to support a finding that the tribal member should be disenrolled. If a majority of the members of the Committee decide that the tribal member should remain on the membership rolls, the disenrollment proceedings shall be deemed closed. If a majority of the members of the Committee find that sufficient evidence exists to support disenrollment, the Committee shall submit a written recommendation to the Tribal Council that the tribal member be disenrolled. The recommendation of the Committee shall include all evidence compiled in the disenrollment proceeding. Upon receipt of such recommendation, the Tribal Council shall schedule a hearing to decide whether the tribal member shall be disenrolled, unless the tribal member has waived his/her right to a hearing by failure to respond to the \"Notice of Disenrollment Proceedings,\" in which event the Tribal Council will make its decision based on the recommendation and evidence furnished by the Committee. (6) Any tribal member subject to a disenrollment proceeding, who has filed a written response to the \"Notice of Disenrollment Proceedings\" with the Enrollment Clerk, shall have the right to be represented by counsel at his or her own expense at all stages of the proceeding, the right to inspect and copy all documents which purportedly support disenrollment, the right to inspect and copy all documents in the custody of the Committee which support the member's claim to continued eligibility for enrollment, the right to inspect and copy all documents in the member's application file, the right to cross-examine all adverse witnesses, the right to present testimony and documentary evidence on his or her own behalf, the right to adequate notice of all proceedings, and the right to a written decision in which the facts relied upon and the conclusions made by the Tribal Council are given. All disenrollment proceedings shall be conducted as closed hearings in Executive Session. (7) In any disenrollment proceeding, the Committee shall have the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the tribal member is not eligible for enrollment. (8) A decision to disenroll a tribal member shall be made by vote of the members of the Tribal Council. No less than five (5) members of the Tribal Council must vote to disenroll the tribal member before such member shall be disenrolled. The decision of the Tribal Council in any disenrollment proceeding shall be final and non-appealable. (9) If the Tribal Council votes to disenroll a tribal member, the Enrollment Clerk shall strike the name of such tribal member from the membership rolls of the Tribe. Any tribal member who has been disenrolled shall be prohibited from thereafter seeking enrollment in the Tribe. (c) Voluntary Disenrollment. Any tribal member may request that his/her name be stricken from the membership rolls. Such voluntary disenrollment must be carried out in accordance with the procedures set forth below. (1) The tribal member seeking voluntary disenrollment must submit to the Enrollment Office a notarized statement requesting relinquishment of membership in the Tribe, and stating the reason(s) for seeking relinquishment of membership. (2) The statement requesting relinquishment of membership in the Tribe must be either submitted in person, or delivered by certified mail, and must be dated no more than sixty (60) days before the date such statement is received at the Enrollment Office. (3) The Tribal Council shall direct the Enrollment Clerk to strike from the membership rolls the name of the tribal member seeking voluntary disenrollment. (4) If a request for relinquishment is made on behalf of a tribal member who is under the age of eighteen (18) years, the following procedures will govern the voluntary disenrollment process: (i) The person requesting relinquishment must be the parent having legal custody of the tribal member, or the legal guardian of such tribal member, and must provide the Enrollment Office with proof of such legal custody or guardianship. For the purposes of this Chapter, the term \"legal custody\" means the custody awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction. Any documentary evidence provided as proof of legal custody or guardianship must be in the form of originals or certified copies. Proof of parenthood alone, without proof of legal custody or guardianship, will not authorize a person to request relinquishment on behalf of a tribal member who is under the age of eighteen (18) years. (ii) Any parent requesting relinquishment for a child who is a tribal member must have sole custody of such child in order to request relinquishment of membership on behalf of the child. If a parent making a request for relinquishment on behalf of a child does not have sole custody of such child, such parent must demonstrate that he/she has joint custody of the child, and a notarized statement from the other parent joining in the request for relinquishment must be provided to the Enrollment Office. Certified copies of the divorce decree or order of separation, and of the order granting custody, must be submitted to the Enrollment Office. (iii) No tribal member under the age of (18) years shall be disenrolled from membership in the Tribe until the Enrollment Office receives official notification from another tribe that such person has been accepted for membership in such other tribe. (iv) If a person who is under the age of eighteen (18) years is disenrolled from membership in the Tribe by request of a parent or legal guardian, such person shall be entitled to enrollment in the Tribe in accordance with the procedures and requirements set forth in this Chapter, if such person makes a request for enrollment after his/her eighteenth (18th) birthday. No benefits associated with membership in the Tribe shall be granted to such person for the period of time during which he/she was not enrolled in the Tribe. Any tribal member whose membership is challenged under subsection (a), (b), or (c) shall have a right to be heard by the Membership Committee, which shall determine if there is sufficient evidence to believe that the tribal member should be disenrolled. If the Committee so finds it shall present its evidence and recommendation to the Tribal Council which shall decide whether the tribal member shall be disenrolled.

An employee is not performing service growing out of and incidental to employment while engaging in a program designed to improve the physical well-being of the employee, whether or not the program is located on the employer's premises, if participation in the program is voluntary and the employee receives no compensation for participation. (D) The premises of the employer include the premises of any other person on whose premises the employee performs service.

(ii) Where the accident or disease causing injury arises out of the employees employment. (iii) Every employee whose employment requires the employee to travel shall be deemed to be performing service growing out of and incidental to the employee's employment at all times while on a trip, except when engaged in a deviation for a private or personal purpose. Acts reasonably necessary for living or incidental thereto shall not be regarded as such a deviation. Any accident or disease arising out of a hazard of such service shall be deemed to arise out of the employee's employment.

(c) Providing or failing to provide any safety inspection or safety advisory service incident to a contract for worker's compensation insurance or to a contract for safety inspections or safety advisory services does not by itself subject an insurer, an employer, insurance service organization to liability for damages for an injury resulting from providing or failing to provide the inspection or services. (d) The right to compensation and the amount of the compensation shall in all cases be determined in accordance with the provisions of a tribal health and disability insurance policy in effect as of the date of the injury.

A hearing may be adjourned in the discretion of the Band, and hearings may be held at such places as the Band designates. (2) In any dispute or controversy pending before the Band, the Band may direct the parties to appear before the Tribal Council for a conference to consider the clarification of issues, the joining of additional parties, the necessity or desirability of amendments to the pleadings, the obtaining of admissions of fact or of documents, records, reports and bills which may avoid unnecessary proof and such other matters as may aid in disposition of the dispute or controversy. After this conference the Tribal Council may issue an order requiring disclosure or exchange of any information or written material which it considers material to the timely and orderly disposition of the dispute or controversy. If a party fails to disclose or exchange within the time stated in the order, the Band may issue an order dismissing the claim without prejudice or excluding evidence or testimony relating to the information or written material. The Band shall provide each party with a copy of any order. (3) All parties shall have the right to be present at any hearing, in person or by attorney, or any other agent, and to present such testimony as may be pertinent to the controversy before the Tribal Council. (4) The contents of certified medical and surgical reports by physicians, podiatrists, surgeons, dentists, psychologists and chiropractors licensed in and practicing in this state and of certified reports by experts concerning loss of earning capacity presented by a party for compensation constitute prima facie evidence as to the matter contained in them, subject to any rules and limitations the Tribal Council prescribes. Certified reports of physicians, podiatrists, surgeons, dentists, psychologists and chiropractors, wherever licensed and practicing, who have examined or treated the claimant, and of experts, if the practitioner or expert consents to subject himself or herself to cross-examination also constitute prima facie evidence as to the matter contained in them. Certified reports of physicians, podiatrists, surgeons, psychologists and chiropractors are admissible as evidence of the diagnosis, necessity of the treatment and cause and extent of the disability. Certified reports by doctors of dentistry are admissible as evidence of the diagnosis and necessity for treatment but not of disability. The record of a hospital or sanatorium in this state operated by any department or agency of the federal or state government or by any municipality, tribe, or of any other hospital or sanatorium in the State of Wisconsin which is satisfactory to the Tribal Council, established by certificate, affidavit or testimony of the supervising officer or other person having charge of such records, or of a physician, podiatrist, surgeon, dentist, psychologist or chiropractor to be the record of the patient in questions, and made in the regular course of examination of such patient, constitutes prima facie evidence in any worker's compensation proceeding as to the matter contained in it, to the extent that it is otherwise competent and relevant. The Tribal Council may, by rule, establish the qualifications of and the form used for certified reports submitted by experts who provide information concerning loss of earning capacity. The Tribal Council may not admit into evidence a certified report of a practitioners or other expert or a record of a hospital or sanatorium that was not filed with the Tribal Council and all parties in interest at least 7 days before the date of the hearing, unless the Tribal Council is satisfied that there is good cause for the failure to file the report. (5) The Tribal Council may, with or without notice to either party, cause testimony to be taken, or an inspection of the premises where the injury occurred to be made, or the time books and payrolls of the Band to be examined by any Tribal Council member examiner, and may direct any employee claiming compensation to be examined by a physician, chiropractor, psychologist, dentist or podiatrist. The testimony so taken, and the results of any such inspection or examination, shall be reported to the Tribal Council for its consideration upon final hearing. All ex parte testimony taken by the Tribal Council shall be reduced to writing and either party shall have opportunity to rebut such testimony on final hearing. (6) Whenever the testimony presented at any hearing indicates a dispute, or is such as to create doubt as to the extent or cause of disability or death, the Tribal Council may direct that the injured employee be examined or autopsy be performed, or an opinion of a physician, chiropractor, dentist, psychologist or podiatrist be obtained without examination or autopsy, but an impartial, competent physician, chiropractor, dentist, psychologist or podiatrist designated by the Tribal Council who is not under contract with or regularly employed by the Band or Insurer. The expense of such examination shall be paid by the Band. The report of such examination shall be transmitted in writing to the Tribal Council and a copy thereof shall be furnished by the Tribal Council to each party, who shall have an opportunity to rebut such report on further hearing. (b) Any party, including the Tribal Council, may require any person to produce books, papers and records at the hearing by personal service of a subpoena upon the person. (c) A party's attorney of record may issue a subpoena to compel the attendance of a witness or the production of evidence. A subpoena issued by an attorney must be in substantially the same form as provided in the Bad River Tribal Code Section 1.15.010 and must be served in the manner provided in the Bad River Tribal Code Section 1.15.020. The attorney shall, at the time of issuance, send a copy of the subpoena to the appeal tribunal or other representative of the Band responsible for conducting the proceeding. (d) Any person who shall willfully and unlawfully fail or neglect to appear or testify or to produce books, papers and records as required, shall be fined not less than $25 nor more than $100.00 each day such person shall so refuse or neglect shall constitute a separate offense. (e) The right of an employee, the employee's legal representative or dependent to proceed under this section shall not extend beyond 12 years from the date of the injury or death or from the date that compensation, other than treatment or burial expenses, was last paid, or would have been payable if no advancement were made, whichever date is latest. (f) This section does not limit the time within which the Band may bring an action to recover benefits fraudulently obtained. (g) If an employee or dependent shall, at the time of injury, or at the time the employee's or dependent's right accrues, be under 18 years of age, the limitations of time within which the employee or dependent may file application or proceed under this chapter , if they would otherwise sooner expire, shall be extended to one year after the employee or dependent attains the age of 18 years. If, within part of the last of any such period of limitation, an employee, the employee's personal representative, or surviving dependent be insane or active duty in the armed forces of the United States such period of limitation shall be extended to 2 years after the date that the limitation would otherwise expire. The provision hereof with respect to persons on active duty in the armed forces of the United States shall apply only where no applicable federal statute is in effect. (h) (1) Testimony or certified reports of expert witnesses on loss of earning capacity may be received in evidence and considered with all other evidence to decide on an employee's actual loss of earning capacity. (2) Except as provided in par. (c), the Tribal Council shall exclude from evidence, testimony or certified reports from expert witnesses under par. (a) offered by the party that raises the issue of loss of earning capacity if that party failed to notify the Tribal Council and the other parties of interest, at least 60 days before the date of the hearing, of the party's intent to provide the testimony or reports and of the names of the expert witnesses involved. Except as provided in par. (c), the Tribal Council shall exclude from evidence testimony or certified reports from expert witnesses under par. (a) offered by a party of interest in response to the party that raises the issue of loss of earning capacity if the responding party failed to notify the Tribal Council and the other parties of interest, at 45 days before the date of the hearing, of the party's intent to provide the testimony or reports and of the names of the expert witnesses involved. (3) Unless otherwise agreed to by all parties, an injured employee shall file with the Tribal Council and serve on all parties at least 15 days before the date of the hearing an itemized statement of all medical expenses and incidental compensation claimed by the injured employee. The itemized statement shall include, if applicable, information relating to any travel expenses incurred by the injured employee in obtaining treatment including the injured employee's destination, number of trips, round trip mileage and meal and lodging expenses. The Tribal Council may not admit into evidence any information relating to medical expenses and incidental compensation claimed by an injured employee if the injured employee failed to file with the Band and serve on all parties at least 15 days before the date of the hearing an itemized statement of the medical expenses and incidental compensation claimed by the injured employee, unless the Tribal Council is satisfied that there is good cause for the failure to file and serve the itemized statement.

The order or award granting or denying compensation, either interlocutory or final, whether judgment has been rendered on it or not, is subject to review only as provided in this section. Within 30 days after the date of an order or award made by the Tribal Council either originally or after the filing of a petition for reconsideration any party aggrieved thereby may be serving a complaint as provided in Bad River Tribal Code Chapter 1.11 and filing the summons and complaint with the clerk of the Bad River Tribal Court commence, in Tribal Court, an action against the Tribal Council for the review of the order or award, in which action the adverse party shall also be made a defendant. If the Tribal Court is satisfied that a party in interest has been prejudiced because of an exceptional delay in the receipt of a copy of any finding or order, it may extend the time in which an action may be commenced by an additional 30 days. (2) In such an action a complaint shall be served with an authenticated copy of the summons. The complaint need not be verified, but shall state the grounds upon which a review is sought. Service upon the Tribal Council or agent authorized by the Tribal Council to accept service constitutes complete service on all parties, but there shall be left with the person so served as many copies of the summons and complaint as there are defendants, and the Tribal Court shall mail one copy to each other defendant. (3) The Tribal Council shall serve its answer within 45 days after the service of the complaint, and, within the like time, the adverse party may serve an answer to the complaint, which answer may, by way of counterclaim or cross complaint, ask for the review of the order referred to in the complaint, with the same effect as if the party had commenced a separate action for the review of the order or award referred to in the complaint, with the same effect as if the party had commenced a separate action for the review thereof. (4) The Tribal Council shall return to the court all of the documents and papers on file in the matter, and of all testimony which has been taken, and of the Council's order, findings and award. Executive sessions minutes shall not have to be made available to any party. The action may thereupon be brought on for hearing before the court upon the record by either party on 10 days notice to the other; subject however, to the provisions of a law for a change of the place of trial or the calling in of another judge. (5) Upon such hearing, the court may confirm or set aside such order or award; and any judgment which may theretofore have been rendered thereon; but the same shall be set aside only upon the following grounds: (A) That the Tribal Council acted without or in excess of its powers. (B) That the order or award was procured by fraud. (C) That the findings of fact by the Tribal Council do not support the order or award by preponderance of the evidence presented before the Council. (b) Upon the trial of any such action the court shall disregard any irregularity or error of the Tribal Council unless it is made to affirmatively appear that the plaintiff was damaged thereby. (c) The record in any case shall be transmitted to the Band within 5 days after expiration of the time for appeal from the order or judgment of the court, unless appeal shall be taken from such order or judgment. (d) Whenever an award is made against the Band, the General Counsel may bring an action for review thereof in the same manner and upon the same grounds as are provided by sub. (1). (e) The commencement of action for review shall not relieve the Band from paying compensation as directed, when such action involves only the question of liability as between the Band and one or more insurance companies or as between several insurance companies. (f) If the Tribal Council's order or award depends on any fact found by the Tribal Council, the court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the Council as to the weight or credibility of the evidence on any finding of fact. The court may, however, set aside the Tribal Council's order or award and remand the case to the Third Party Administrator or Tribal Benefits Specialist or if the Tribal Council's order or award depends on any material and controverted finding of fact that is not supported by credible and substantial evidence.

(2) The tribal conservation department may issue a gillnetting permit for any lake open to gillnetting, except for the southern basin of Trout Lake (Vilas County) so long as the lake trout harvest by state anglers is prohibited on that water body, provided: (a) An open season exists for the species to be fished; (b) The permit shall be valid for no more than 1 day for any species; (c) The permit establishes the respective daily bag limits for walleye and muskellunge which may be less than but shall not exceed the respective tribal quota for walleye and muskellunge remaining in that lake; (d) Except as provided in subs. (14), any number of permits may be issued at any one time for any lake but the total length in feet of all gillnets authorized for all permits on any one lake shall not exceed the number of walleye remaining available for harvest in that lake multiplied by 10; (e) Gillnetting for all species is limited to one body of water for the duration of the permit; (f) No gillnetting permit issued pursuant to this section and netting permit issued pursuant to Section 9.07 [Dip Nets, Fyke Nets and Seines Regulated] shall be simultaneously valid for any body of water; (g) The permit requires the member's signature; (h) Except as provided in subs. (14), the permit establishes the maximum length in feet and the mesh size of the gillnet which is authorized as determined from the spring walleye population average length and the following chart: Spring Length (Stretched) Maximum Allowable Mesh Size 13.5\" 2.5\" 13.5 - 16.49\" 3.0\" No Length Data (NR Model) 3.0\" No Length Data (ST and NR2/ REM Model) 3.5\" 16.5 - 18.49\" 3.5\" 18.5 - 20.49\" 4.0\" 20.5\" and under 4.5\" (i) (i) For lakes with no current length data (which otherwise would not be open to gillnetting), the allowable gillnet mesh size will be 3.0 inch for lakes with walleye recruitment codes used in the NR model, and 3.5 inch for lakes with recruitment codes used in the ST and NR2/REM models. (ii) For all lakes with an allowable gillnet mesh size of 3.0 inches, 4.0 inches, and 4.5 inches (including lakes with no current data as described in section A above), 3.5 inch mesh nets may also be used. However, for lakes with an allowable mesh size of 3.0 inches the following will apply whenever 3.5 inch mesh nets are used: (1) If an adult population estimate is conducted during spring of the year that gillnetting takes place, no reduction to the remaining walleye quota will occur. The Inland Fisheries Technical Working Group (TWG) will continue to evaluate the effects of using 3.5 inch mesh on the number of walleye 20 inches and larger in these lakes. (2) If an adult walleye population estimate is not conducted during spring of the year that gillnetting takes place, the remaining walleye quota will be reduced by twenty four percent (24%). This reduction would on average, keep harvest the harvest of walleye 20 inches and larger the same as what it would have been using 3.0 inch mesh gillnets (iii) No other mesh size may be used on lakes with an allowable mesh size of 2.5 inches. (iv) In determining the spring average length of walleye, data gathered by the use of any appropriate gear, such as fyke nets, electro-shocking or spearing, may be utilized provided that an accurate assessment of walleye size can be accomplished. (j) The tribal conservation department or the Commission may impose such other terms and conditions as it deems appropriate or necessary, including such biological monitoring requirements appropriate to the level of harvest activity on any body of water. (3) No member shall fish by the use of a gillnet contrary to the terms and conditions of any gillnetting permit which has been issued to him or her. (4) No member shall fish with the use of a gillnet which does not meet the requirements of Section 9.01 (3) [Gillnet Defined]. (5) No member shall possess any fish harvesting device other than a gillnet while engaged in gillnetting under this section, except that a member may possess spears pursuant to Section 9.06 or devices for open water hook and line fishing, snagging and/or set lines while setting gillnets. (6) No member shall share gillnetting equipment authorized under this section with any person who is not a member of a signatory tribe, except as provided in Section 3.30 [Permissible Conduct/Assistance by Non-Member]. (7) Where the annual tribal quota for any fish species as established pursuant to Section 9.03 [Number of Fish Available for Harvest] has been taken on a body of water by any method or combination of methods: (a) No gillnetting under this section may take place on that body of water until the following fishing year; and (b) The tribal conservation department shall not issue permits for gillnetting on that particular body of water for the remainder of the fishing year. (8) In imposing appropriate mesh size restrictions on a gillnet permit, the tribal conservation department shall consult with the Commission's Biological Services Division and any size restriction shall take into account the length distribution of the adult fish population in the lake to be fished. (9) No member shall fish with any gillnet unless the gillnet is marked in compliance with the following provisions: (a) Each gillnet shall be marked with two flags on the inside of the net and one flag on the outside; (b) Each flag pole shall be three feet or more above the water and have a diameter of two-and-one-half inches or less; (c) Each flag shall be white and ten inches square or larger; and (d) Each pole shall have attached securely to it an identification tag issued by the tribal conservation department showing the member's tribal affiliation and tribal identification number. (10) No member shall set a gillnet in open water with a topline within 3 feet of the water's surface unless the gillnet is buoyed at 500 foot intervals. (11) No member shall set any gillnet in a manner in which any part of the net is in less than ten feet of water, or in an unsafe manner which shall unreasonably expose boaters and other users of the lake to a foreseeable risk of imminent bodily harm or property damage, or contrary to such other restrictions as the tribal conservation department may require. (12) No member shall remove a gillnet from a lake without first removing from the gillnet and returning all crayfish to the water or killing all crayfish entangled in the gillnet. (13) No member shall fail to lift any gillnet at least two times in each continuous 24 hour period during which the net is set, or more frequently as water temperatures may require so as to avoid the spoilage of any fish taken by the net. (14) Notwithstanding the provisions of subs. (2)(d) and (2)(h), the tribal conservation department may issue a permit for gillnetting ciscos (tulibees) and whitefish on such terms and conditions as it deems necessary or appropriate, provided that at a minimum all other provisions of this section shall otherwise apply to cisco and whitefish gillnetting permits. Section 9.09. Setlines and Set or Bank Poles Regulated. (1) No member shall fish with or set any setline or set or bank pole except in accordance with the following provisions: (a) A maximum of 20 set or bank poles and 1 setline may be used in no more than 3 bodies of water at any one time.

(h) Set or bank poles and setlines may only be set, attended or lifted from one hour before sunrise to one-half hour past sunset. (i) The tribal conservation department may impose such other terms and conditions as it deems appropriate or necessary, including such biological monitoring requirements appropriate to the level of harvest activity on any body of water. (2) No member shall fish with any set or bank pole or setline which does not meet the requirements of Section 9.01 (10) [Set or Bank Pole Defined] or Section 9.01 (11) [Setline Defined]. (3) No member shall possess any fish harvesting device other than a set or bank pole or setline while setting, lifting or attending a set or bank pole or setline, except that a member may simultaneously possess a set line or bank pole while setting fyke nets pursuant to Section 9.07 or setting gillnets pursuant to Section 9.08 . (4) No member shall share any set or bank pole or setline with any person who is not a member of a signatory tribe, except as provided in Section 3.30 [Permissible Conduct/Assistance by Non-Members].

(2) who have completed an advanced hunter safety/marksmanship training course and received a marksmanship proficiency certificate from the tribe, as follows: (a) The tribal conservation department shall issue firearms marksmanship proficiency certificates once the qualification shoot is completed during nighttime hours with a minimum score of 80% of better (10 shots) within the six and one-quarter inch inner circle of a NRA certified target at 100 yards. Firearms allowable for certification are those firearms otherwise allowable for elk hunting pursuant to section 15.09 of this ordinance. (b) The tribal conservation department shall issue bow/crossbow marksmanship proficiency certificates once the qualification shoot it completed during nighttime hours with a minimum score of 80% or better (10 shots) within the six and one-quarter inch inner circle of an NRA certified target at 30 yards. Bows/crossbows allowable for certification are those bows/crossbows otherwise allowable for elk hunting pursuant to Section 15.10 of this ordinance. (9) Once a permit pursuant to subs. (2) has been certified, the tribal conservation department shall provide for the advance notification of appropriate federal, state and local officials, as those officials request notification, by providing a list of the tribal hunting identification numbers of authorized members and copies of preapproved shooting plans which contain sufficient detail to determine the hunting location. Section 15.19. Authorization for Closure. The Commission's Biological Services Director, or his or her designate, is hereby delegated the authority to close any elk management zone, or portion of an elk management zone, to elk hunting prior to the season's closing date, provided there is no tribal quota remaining in that zone, or when it appears imminent that more than the tribal quota for that zone will be harvested prior to the expiration of the next permit period. Section 15.20. Removal and Retention of Tags. (1) No member who kills an elk pursuant to this ordinance shall remove a carcass tag or registration tag from that elk until such time as the carcass is butchered. (2) No member who kills an elk pursuant to this ordinance shall dispose of the registration tag until the meat is consumed. (3) Any person who receives any meat from a member as a gift or pursuant to Section 15.16 [Sale to Members] from a member who retains a registration tag under this section is not required to possess a registration tag. Section 15.21. Assistance by Non-Members. (1) Conduct which is not expressly prohibited, restricted or otherwise regulated by this ordinance shall be deemed permissible. (2) Except as provided in subs. (3) or as otherwise provided herein, nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to prohibit a member from hunting elk with any other person who is not a member of the Band, provided that such other person possesses a license or permit, or is otherwise not prohibited from engaging in the activity involved and complies with applicable laws. (3) No person who is not a member or a member of another signatory tribe shall assist a member in the hunting of elk pursuant to this ordinance except as provided in Section 3.30 [Permissible Conduct/Assistance by Non-Members].

GENERAL PRINCIPLES A. Each Party shall enact regulations as necessary to facilitate and effectuate this Agreement. Each Party shall provide the other Parties copies of such regulations within 10 working days of their adoption. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit any Party from adopting more restrictive regulations than those prescribed herein. B. Commercial licensees of the Tribes shall be free to fish the Wisconsin waters of Lake Superior, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, and except as the Tribes may otherwise from time to time prescribe within the framework of this Agreement. C. Except insofar as prescribed by this Agreement, each Party retains sole discretion to subdivide its allocation of any quota among its user groups and prescribe such regulations that may be necessary or appropriate to ensure such Party's allocation is not exceeded. D. The Parties agree to meet at least once per year to discuss the implementation of the Agreement, including but not limited to the manner in which the joint law enforcement and biological monitoring provisions are accomplished. The meeting shall be held in September of each year. The Parties may also meet as needed upon the request of any other Party. III. BIOLOGICAL COMMITTEE A. The Parties shall establish a State-Tribal \"Biological Committee\", the membership of which shall be comprised of biological representatives of each Party. The Biological Committee shall be advisory to the Parties as described herein. B. The Biological Committee shall be charged with the following responsibilities: 1. Developing and revising assessment techniques and models as necessary or required by this Agreement; 2. Performing research as necessary to further the purposes of this Agreement; 3. Reviewing assessment data collected pursuant to this Agreement; 4. Reviewing reporting needs; 5. Calculating quotas established in this Agreement; 6. Exchanging documents, data and information as required by this Agreement; 7. Producing reports required by this Agreement; and 8. Making other science-based recommendations as requested by the Parties. C. The Biological Committee will meet following the end of each Period (January, May and September) and report to the Parties on the status of native species management in Lake Superior. The Biological Committee may also meet additionally as needed or as requested by the Parties. D. As needed or as appropriate, the Biological Committee shall discuss the following items during the course of its annual meetings: 1. Quotas for lean lake trout and other species for which quotas have been established; 2. Updates on a per period basis on all species harvested, including commercial, home use and angler harvest; 3. Home use harvest during the closed lean lake trout season; 4. Commercial harvest updates for cisco and whitefish; 5. Assessment activities; 6. Stocking; 7. Data to be shared with the Great Lakes Fishery Commission Lake Superior Technical Committee; 8. Data and research needs, including inter-party coordination of efforts; 9. Commercial reporting; 10. Annual reports; 11. Exchange of information; 12. Model development and improvements; and 13. Any other matter for which the Biological Committee has been directed by the Parties to discuss E. At a time to be mutually agreed, assessment fisheries for the coming fishing year shall be reviewed by members of the Biological Committee in the interest of promoting cooperation and efficient efforts. IV. FISHING SEASONS &amp; PERIODS A. Except for fish harvested for Tribal home use in conformity with Section X and whitefish harvested in conformity with Section VII, the fishing season for lean lake trout and whitefish shall open on November 28 and close on September 30 of the subsequent year. No nets shall be set for any species during the closed season for that species. B. The commercial fishing season for lean lake trout and whitefish shall be divided into three periods: 1. Period 1: November 28 through March 31; 2. Period 2: April 1 through May 31; and 3. Period 3: June 1 through September 30. C. The fishing season for cisco shall begin on January 1 of each year and end on December 31 of the same year. V. LEAN LAKE TROUT QUOTAS &amp; ALLOCATION A. The Parties agree that the Biological Committee shall, within three years, develop a lean lake trout model for WI-1 for consideration by Parties, with annual progress reports made during the annual meeting of the Parties. Until such time as the Parties agree to adopt a system for calculating the WI-1 quota, the annual lean lake trout quota for WI-1 shall be fixed at 14,500 lean lake trout. B. An annual lean lake trout quota for WI-2 shall be calculated every three years or as otherwise agreed to by the Parties using the Lake Trout Statistical Catch at Age Model. C. To confine the lean lake trout mortality to a 42% total annual mortality rate, the annual lean lake trout quota for WI-2 shall be established as follows: 1. The Parties agree to estimate a quota based on an annual mortality of 42%. 2. Age-specific instantaneous commercial fishing mortality will be set so that total annual mortality will be 42% for the age most vulnerable to commercial harvest. 3. The recommended quota will be the average total harvest (sport and commercial) predicted for the next 3 years, based on assumed mortality rates and projected lake trout abundance as projected by the SCAA model. D. Lean lake trout allocations shall be derived as follows: 1. The initial quotas for WI-1 and WI-2 shall first be reduced by the numbers needed for assessment (WI-1: 500 for State; WI-2: 1000 for State, 500 per Tribe). 2. The remaining fish shall be divided equally between the State and the Tribes (combined). 3. The Tribal allocation in each zone shall be apportioned equally between the Bad River and Red Cliff Tribes. 4. At this time the Tribes have less need of an allocation in WI-1 and more of a need for an allocation in WI-2. Conversely, at this time the State has more of a need for an allocation in WI-1 and less of a need for an allocation in WI-2. Hence the Parties agree to a voluntary, nonprecedential exchange of fish between WI-1 and WI-2. Bad River shall annually retain 500 tags in WI-1 and in exchange for 3,000 additional tags in WI-2. Red Cliff shall annually retain 1,500 tags in WI-1 and in exchange for 2,000 additional tags in WI-2. The State's annual allocation in WI-1 shall increase by 5,000 and decrease in WI-2 by 5,000. 5. The State further agrees to annually transfer 6,000 tags from its WI-2 allocation to the Tribes in exchange for reduced commercial fishing within the Van Tassell's Point Restricted Fishing Area. The Tribes agree that 3,000 of these tags shall be allocated to the Bad River Tribe and that 3,000 of these tags shall be allocated to the Red Cliff. E. For the 2018, 2019 and 2020 seasons, the lake trout quota and allocation shall be as follows: WI-1 WI-2 State Bad River Red Cliff State Bad River Red Cliff Initial Allocation 7,000 3,500 3,500 36,500 18,250 18,250 WI-1/WI-2 Tag Swap +5,000 -3,000 -2,000 -5,000 +3,000 +2,000 Allocation Adjustment for WI-2 N/A N/A N/A -6,000 +3,000 +3,000 Total Allocation: 12,000 500 1,500 25,500 24,250 23,250 WI-1 TAC: 14,000 WI-2 TAC: 73,000 Assessment Tags 500 0 0 1,000 0 0 Total WI-1 Assessment Tags: 500 Total WI-2 Assessment Tags: 2,000 Total Quotas WI-1 Total: 14,500 WI-2 Total: 75,000 Combined Totals: 89,500 1. encompasses all State users, including sport fishers. The Tribal allocation encompasses all Tribal users, including home use fishers. Each Party retains discretion as to the portion of its lean lake trout allocation it will annually set aside for non-commercial purposes, but shall inform the other Parties of this number before the start of the lake trout fishing season. 2. Bad River agrees to annually reserve 900 fish from its Tribal allocation for home-use harvest activity. Red Cliff agrees to annually reserve 400 fish from its Tribal allocation for home-use fishing. Any unused portion of these fish can be reallocated to the commercial component of the fishery no later than August 1. When and if home use fish are reallocated to the commercial fishery, a sum of 100 fish will be retained from the available balance for home use activity during the remainder of the quota year. The following formula will be used to calculate effort limitations for utilization of reallocated home use fish. Available Balance - 100 -------------------------------- X 1,000 = Effort Limitation for Period 3 CPE Reallocated Home Use Fish 3. Should monitoring reveal that either the sport or home use fisheries have exceeded or are likely to exceed the amount allocated the responsible Party agrees to take emergency measures to prevent the excess harvest. Should such measures be unavailable the excess shall be deducted from the allocation of the responsible Party in the next fishing year. VI. WHITEFISH, CISCO &amp; MISCELLANEOUS SPECIES A. There shall be no restriction on the sale of any species of fish taken in Wisconsin waters of Lake Superior by Red Cliff and Bad River Tribal commercial fishers, except that the following species may not be sold: brown, brook, rainbow and splake trout; salmon; lake sturgeon; bass; yellow perch, northern pike and panfish. B. The commercial harvest of walleye, rough fish and detrimental fish is permitted in accordance with Section XIV. C. Experimental October Whitefish Season: The Parties agree to create an experimental October Whitefish Season, in which any Party may authorize participation by its licensed commercial fishers. 1. The following regulations shall apply to participants in fishery, unless more restrictive regulations are adopted by the license-issuing Party: b. The season shall begin on October 3 and end on October 24, when all nets must be removed from the water. c. Gillnets may be set in those areas of WI-2 that are less than 15 fathoms in depth and which are designated as non-exclusion zones denoted in the October Whitefish Fishery Zones and Spawning Sites map (Appendix B). d. Allowable gillnet gear types shall include suspended set, bottom set or legged nets with a minimum of 4 7/16\" stretch measure. e. Tribal big boat licenses and State commercial fishers may set up to 6,000 feet of the allowable gillnet gear types in total. Each gillnet shall be lifted a minimum of once every 48 hours. f. All lake trout incidentally caught must be tagged and retained. A licensed fisher cannot participate in the fishery if they do not possess lake trout tags. 2. The experiment shall be conducted during a five-year period, with an evaluation occurring in the fourth year of the study. 3. At the conclusion of the fifth year, the Biological Committee shall prepare a report, which may include recommendations concerning the long-term continuation of the season and any regulatory changes that may be needed to address sustainability, enforceability, and other relevant factors. D. Cisco. The Parties acknowledge that the State has implemented an annual cisco quota for WI-1 and WI-2, applicable to state-licensed fishers and effective for each of the 2018, 2019 and 2020 calendar years. As currently established, such quota shall not exceed 15 percent of the most recent estimate of the biomass of cisco in Wisconsin waters of Lake Superior. The quota is subject to evaluation every three years. Based on this schedule, the quota shall either be renewed or revised with an effective date of January 1, 2021. To meet this deadline, the evaluation process will begin in 2019. The Tribes agree to participate in the evaluation of the cisco quota. Working cooperatively, the Parties agree to assess the current quota and make revisions as necessary. The Parties agree to implement the result of this process as a three-party quota, effective January 1, 2021. The Parties may additionally agree to the schedule by which the quota will be recalculated or revised in the future. E. The Parties agree that for purposes of future management of whitefish in Lake Superior that it would be desirable to develop Statistical Catch At Age (SCAA) models for whitefish and any other species as agreed to by the Parties. SCAA models shall be based on appropriate grids and stocks for the species at issue. Such models would not necessarily lead to developing quotas, but would be used to determine the health of the populations and sustainability of current harvest levels. The Biological Committee shall investigate the technical and financial requirements of developing this model and provide a report to the Parties no later than December 31, 2021. VII. COMMERCIAL FISHING EFFORT &amp; GEAR A. The Parties agree that the Biological Committee shall undertake a study of each Parties' regulations with respect to fishing gear and effort for the purpose of achieving greater consistency and reducing biological impacts. Such a study shall assess current regulations and any potential options identified for the biological considerations, associated costs and other factors as appropriate. The Biological Committee shall prepare a report for consideration by the Parties by December 31, 2021, with annual progress reports provided at the annual meeting of the Parties. The Parties agree that trap regulations shall be the priority of the study during the first year. B. Regulation of Gillnet Effort 1. The Parties agree to regulate the amount of large mesh gill net that may be fished during each of the three periods in the fishing year. The allowable effort for a Party shall be based on the lean lake trout quota and the Catch Per Unit of Effort (CPE) monitored in the fishery of each Party. Allowable effort shall be calculated for each of the three periods in the fishing year according to the formula below, using the period dates established in Section IV.B, except as provided in Paragraph 5. Period 1 Available Allocation ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- X 1000 =Period 1 Effort Limitation Period 1 CPE Period 2 (Unused Effort from Period 1/1000) x Period 1 CPE ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- X 1000 =Period 2 Effort Limitation Period 2 CPE Period 3 (Unused Effort from Period 2/1000) x Period 2 CPE ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- X 1000 =Period 3 Effort Limitation Period 3 CPE 2. CPE is defined as the average number of lean lake trout caught per 1,000 foot lift of large mesh gill net. CPE includes all dead and live lake trout. A separate CPE shall be used for each period except as provided in Paragraph 5. CPE values for Periods 1 and 2 shall be decreased by 10% to account for return of live fish. CPE values for a given period shall be the average of the monitored CPE in that period during the preceding three years (hereafter referred to as three year rolling average) except as provided in Paragraph 3. Each Party shall use its own separately calculated CPE for each period, except that a Party failing to meet the standard set out in Paragraph 4 for a period shall be deemed to have the three-party weighted average CPE (CPE by lift) for that period in determining the remaining footage available, and that shall be its CPE for inclusion in the three-year rolling average. 3. Previous agreements have included the following provision: \"If in any fishing year the actual jointly monitored CPE for any given period exceeds the rolling average CPE that was calculated for that period and year by more than 50%, the actual CPE shall be used in the following year rather than the rolling average. Unless the expected CPE in the next year is again exceeded by 50%, the CPE calculation for the next year will go back to the rolling average, using the prior three years.\" 4. CPE values shall be based on a statistically adequate number of jointly monitored lifts, as joint monitoring is described in Section XI. A statistically adequate number will be obtained if during each period: 1. At least 7% of all big boat lifts by each Party or at least one big boat lift per fishing week by a Party is jointly monitored; and 2. All big boats of that Party are jointly monitored at least once during a period in which they fish at least five days. The foregoing standard for joint monitoring shall be met unless a failure is due to unforeseen or hazardous circumstances unanimously agreed by the Biological committee for CPEs or the Law Enforcement Committee for effort monitoring. The Parties shall periodically evaluate the foregoing standard and may revise the standard if mutually agreeable. If a signatory notifies the other Parties in a timely fashion that it will have difficulties in providing a monitor(s) the other Parties will temporarily (if possible) provide a monitor(s) until the initial Party can once again provide a monitor(s). 5. Any Party shall have the option to calculate CPE and manage the allowable effort for Periods 1 and 2 combined. Allowable effort and CPE shall be calculated using procedures described in Paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 except that a single CPE for Periods 1 and 2 shall be calculated and used to compute allowable effort for both periods combined, using the following formulas. Periods 1 &amp; 2 Available Allocation ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- X 1000 =Period (1+2) Effort Limitation Period (1+2) CPE Period 3 (Unused Effort from Periods (1+2)/1000) x Periods (1+2) CPE ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- X 1000 =Period 3 Effort Limitation Period 3 CPE The allowable effort for each individual fisherman shall be calculated in the same manner as the overall Tribal effort, except that the fishermen's individual fish allocation shall be used instead of the Tribal fish allocation. 6. The Parties agree to establish a system of effort control for large mesh gill nets placed in waters less than 330 feet (55 fathoms). Each Parties' system shall allocate and enforce individual fishing effort limits in terms of maximum net footage allowed, based upon individual lake trout tag allocations. These systems, employing individual seasonal harvest declarations, individual net length markings and bimonthly catch and effort reports, shall be administered in such manner that the sum of the net footage allocated to and actually fished by each individual fisher, multiplied by the CPE applicable to each period during which the footage is actually fished, does not exceed the Party's annual lake trout allocation. Except as provided in Paragraph 5, individual allocations shall be recalculated at the onset of Periods 2 and 3 to assure this result. The exceeding of an individual's annual allowable effort allocation shall be a prosecutable offense. Individual fishing effort allocations may not be transferred except by writings signed by transferor and transferee, verified and dated by signature of the fisheries biologist and filed with that person who shall give notice to the other Parties to the Agreement upon reasonable request. No such transfer or claim of such transfer shall be entertained as a defense to a prosecution for exceeding fishing effort except where the written transfer was filed and verified prior to the date of the alleged offense. 7. The Biological Committee and the wardens of the Parties shall meet within 20 days of the close of each of the three fishing periods to calculate the actual observed CPE from that period. The biologists shall also determine whether the CPE calculation shall result in the effort adjustments required by Section VII.B.6 for periods 2 and 3 or the exception to the CPE rolling average required by Section VII.B.1. The wardens will compare reported effort by grid by day with monitored effort. C. Gillnet Requirements. The Parties agree that all gillnets shall have the following standard requirements. 1. Each Party shall enact gillnet size standards that minimally require the following: Gill nets must be greater than 4 1/4 inch stretch measure (large mesh) or between 2 3/8 and 3 inch stretch measure (small mesh). 2. All large mesh gill nets shall have standard lifting requirements. Each gill net shall be lifted a minimum of (1) once every 72 hours (3 days) in open water less than 96 feet (16 fathoms) deep, or (2) once every 120 hours (5 days) in open water 96 to 210 feet (16 to 35 fathoms) deep, or (3) once every 240 hours (10 days) in open water more than 210 feet (35 fathoms) deep, or (4) once every 120 hours (5 days) in commercial ice fishing. To the extent any Party's regulations recognize an inclement weather exception, the regulations shall be construed to place the burden on the commercial fisher to prove that inclement weather or similar dangers prevented the timely lifting of nets. Failure to use available means of notifying the appropriate law enforcement authority in advance shall constitute prima facie evidence that the failure to lift was not due to inclement weather. Regulations promulgated by any Party shall require fishers to lift nets as soon as practicable after the inclement weather subsides. D. Trap Net Requirements. The Parties agree that all trap nets shall have standard fishing requirements. 1. The pot or crib must be set, placed and operated in water not more than 90 feet (15 fathoms) deep. 2. Each commercial fisher may use no more than 10 nets, pots or cribs. 3. Each trap net shall be lifted a minimum of once every 168 hours (7 days). 4. The fish holding pot portion of the net shall be rendered inoperable during the closed season for whitefish and lake trout and shall have the webbing removed from the water within 3 days after the close of the lake trout (open) season. 5. Nets may not be placed or operated during the months of April through September if the mesh covering the top of hearts of the nets is less than 14 inch stretch. 6. Nets may not be placed or operated from a boat or watercraft from November 28 through March 31. 7. Nets fished in the Van Tassells Point restricted fishing area may harvest only whitefish and lake herring. 8. The location restrictions imposed in Par. VII(D)1. and Par. VII(E)1., below, may be reopened after three years upon a showing that there are one or more additional Tribal members ready and willing to operate entrapment gear but are precluded from obtaining an effective placement due to these restrictions. E. All Nets. The Parties agree that the following regulations shall apply to all nets. 1. No trap net or gill net may be placed within \u00bc mile of any other trap net or gill net. 2. Within 24 hours of setting any portion of a net, the net must be fully set and begin actively fishing. 3. Nets may not be placed or operated within 1/2 mile of a designated trout stream. F. Gear Identification. The Parties agree that nets shall be marked in the following fashion. 1. Tribal nets shall be marked in such way as to designate the fisher's license number and Tribe (specifically including the initials 'RC' or 'BR'). State nets shall be marked in such way as to designate the fisher's license number. 2. All large mesh gill nets used by Tribal fishers shall include an informational tag placed in a secured pocket of the outside buoy. Each tag shall state the date on which the gill net was set, the length of the gang of nets and the license number of the fisher. Additionally, a minimum of five floats on each end of the gang shall be marked with the net owner's license number. 3. Each Party shall adopt ice buoy standards applicable to commercial fishers licensed by that Party that minimally require the following: a. Ice buoys shall have an overall minimum length of 12 feet; b. At least two feet of any ice buoy shall be above water with the license number of the commercial fisherman visible; and c. The top foot of the above-water portion of an ice buoy shall be marked with a high visibility color. VIII. EXPERIMENTAL EFFORT CARRY-OVER SYSTEM A. The Parties agree to an experimental, non-precedential large mesh gill net effort carry over system. A Party which so elects may carry over a portion of its unused lean lake trout effort from one fishing year into the subsequent fishing year only. The amount of effort to be carried over into the subsequent fishing year shall be determined based on the number of unused lake trout tags remaining at the end of prior fishing year. To derive this number, the Parties shall perform the following calculations: 1. First, the electing Party shall determine the lower of the following: a. The number of lean lake trout tags left over and turned in at the end of the fishing year in which the Party has unused lake trout effort; or b. The number of lean lake trout effort unfished by that Party during the fishing year in which the Party has unused lake trout effort, calculated by dividing the amount of unused footage by that Party's CPE for period 3 of that year. When calculating this value the Parties shall use the quota from the fishing year in which the Party has unused lake trout effort. 2. Second, the lower of these values shall further be reduced by multiplying by 0.8531, reflecting an annual natural mortality rate of 0.1469, and which shall in no case exceed 25% of the Party's lean lake trout allocation for fishing season that has just ended. 3. Third, the value derived in subpar. 2 shall be divided by the period 3 CPE for the upcoming fishing year, and multiplied by 1000. The resulting number shall be the amount of effort available for carry over. B. Experimental carry over effort calculated under this Section may only be used during period 3 of the subsequent fishing year. A Party electing to carry over effort shall report the amount of effort to be carried over to the other Parties by December 1 of each year, or within 10 days of receiving from the State the commercial monitoring summary for Wisconsin waters of Lake Superior fishing during period 3 (June 1 \u2013 September 30) of the fishing year in which the Party has unused effort, whichever is later. Such report by the electing Party of the intended carry over shall include the calculations used to derive the carry over value, which is subject to verification by any other Party. IX. HOME USE A. Tribal members are permitted to fish for home use in accordance with the provisions of this Section, and only when in possession of a valid home use license or Tribal ID issued by the appropriate Tribe. B. Fish harvested for home use may not be sold. C. In no instance may a commercial boat fish both commercial and home use nets at the same time. If such home use nets are fished by a commercial licensee, they must be labeled as home use and contain the same information as required for commercial nets. D. Sections VII.C.2. and VII.E.1. apply to gill nets set for home use. E. The Tribes will limit the use of home use gill nets to mesh sizes of 2 3/4\" (stretch measure) or smaller, and 4 \u00bd\" (stretch measure) or larger. F. During the open season for lake trout, the Tribes agree to limit the length of home use nets to a total of 800 feet per fishers. During the closed season for lake trout, the Tribe agrees to limit the length of such nets to a total of 500 feet per fishers. At all times, said nets will be marked by at least one buoy at the lakeward end of the net and said buoy will contain information required by Tribal regulations. G. During the closed season for lake trout, the Tribes agree to restrict gill net placement so that no part of any net extends beyond 1,320 feet from the shoreline into waters adjacent to the Reservation. The Tribes will each provide quarterly home use fishing harvest information on forms supplied by the Department. Each Tribe will affix authorized tags to all species of game fish taken. The Tribes agree to review the reporting and enforcement systems with the Department at six month intervals after the effective date of this Agreement. The Department will compensate the Tribes for the actual costs of reporting and tagging. H. For purposes of enforcing these provisions, the Department will refer all detected violations of this Agreement to Tribal enforcement authorities. The Tribe will provide the Department with records of disposition in such cases. Department and Tribal enforcement personnel will endeavor to work cooperatively. I. The Parties have not yet concluded discussions concerning the use of home use nets in Chequamegon Bay. The Parties agree to continue their discussions, with a commitment to conclude them by March 31, 2019. X. LAKE TROUT TAGGING A. That portion of the State and Tribal lean lake trout allocation assigned to commercial fishing shall be enforced by the use of tags, distributed by the Department and the Tribes respectively. B. The State and the Tribes shall enact and maintain secure systems for the tagging of lean lake trout. Such systems shall employ serially numbered, once-lockable tags, identifying the issuing Party, to be issued in fixed numbers to individual fishers pursuant to applicable allocations, and so recorded. Such systems shall further require lean lake trout harvested on open waters to be tagged, i.e., a tag affixed to the fish and securely locked, before docking, and lake trout harvested on the ice to be similarly tagged before being transported. C. Such tags are to be valid only for the fishing year of issuance and are to be color coded so as to distinguish between any two consecutive fishing years. The Parties agree to coordinate the purchase of lake trout tags so that all Parties order the same color tag for a given fishing year. Additional costs borne by the Tribes in maintaining a color-coded system are to be compensated by the Department. All unused tags issued for the commercial harvest of lean lake trout shall be returned to the appropriate Party within 15 days of the close of the fishing season for that species. D. On or before November 1 of each fishing year each Party shall notify the others of the proportion of the Party's allocation it intends to devote to noncommercial fishing, and shall reduce the amount of tags available to commercial users by the amount so allocated. E. On or before November 15th of each year, each Party to inform the others in writing of the number, serial numbers and physical type of tag to be used in the coming fishing year. F. To the extent Tribal tagging regulations recognize an inclement weather exception, the regulations shall be construed to place the burden on the fisher to prove that inclement weather or similar dangers prevented the timely tagging of the fish. Failure to use available means of notifying Tribal wardens in advance, and the fact that fish were dressed, shall constitute prima facie evidence that the failure to tag was not due to inclement weather. G. The Tribes shall adopt regulations on the tagging of lake trout fillets which substantially conform to current State regulations, or shall adopt an alternative system for assuring the tagging of fillets, acceptable to the Department. H. No lake trout harvested in Michigan shall be docked in Wisconsin unless they are tagged in conformity with a tagging system assuring the secure issuance of a limited number of tags. If the tags involved are furnished by Michigan Tribal sources, the Tribes shall furnish the Department with the details and text of the regulations regulating the amount of tags and the methods of their issuance. If a secure system of limited tag issuance is not otherwise in place the Tribes agree to provide such a tagging system themselves, prescribed and enforced by their own ordinances. I. No combined catch of Wisconsin and Michigan lake trout shall be docked in Wisconsin. Nor shall any fisher lift nets in Wisconsin with Michigan lake trout aboard. J. Tribal fishers fishing in Wisconsin Waters of Lake Superior shall not have tags for Michigan lake trout in their possession. K. All lean lake trout caught in gill nets set in waters less than 330 feet (55 fathoms) shall be kept and tagged except that live lake trout caught during Periods 1 and 2 may be returned to the water. XI. MONITORING A. The Tribes shall monitor the non-commercial harvest of lake trout, notify the State of the methods of monitoring employed and provide information on the harvest, according to the schedule in Section XVIII. B. The State shall similarly monitor the sport harvest of lake trout, keep the Tribes apprised of the methods of monitoring employed and provide information on the harvest, according to the schedule Section XVIII. Tribal biologists/technicians may accompany State monitors. C. Joint monitoring is defined as a big boat lift monitored by at least one State representative and one Tribal representative. Joint biological monitoring shall not be conducted in conjunction with any enforcement activity unless requested by the biological staffs. However, joint law enforcement effort checks on the ice have the option of monitoring lifts for CPE data provided that such data is shared with biological personnel from the appropriate management agency within 6 working days. The number of monitorings forming the base for CPE calculations is set forth in Section VII.B.4. Failure of one Party to participate in the joint monitoring session after being notified of the proposed joint monitoring shall not result in the discarding of the data from that monitoring session. The contact shall be made at a reasonable time, but no later than 9 p.m. on the evening before the monitoring, with the individuals involved in the monitoring effort. Contact occurs when the initiating Party leaves a voice message; speaks to the individual involved in the monitoring effort, or sends a text message (if text messaging services are enabled). The contact must be made at the number designated by the Party being contacted, which shall have a functioning answering machine or service attached. When the State monitors State-licensed commercial fishers, contact should be to both Bad River and Red Cliff. D. Each Party shall be responsible for jointly monitoring a statistically adequate number of lifts per period. A statistically adequate number of lifts for the following gear types is separately obtained if during each period: 1. For Gill Nets: a. At least 7% of all big boat lifts by each Party or at least one big boat lift per fishing week by a Party is jointly monitored; and b. All big boats of that Party are jointly monitored at least once during a period in which they fish at least five days. 2. For Trap Nets: a. At least 7% of all lifts by each Party or at least one lift per fishing week by a Party is jointly monitored; and b. All boats of that Party are jointly monitored at least once during a period in which they fish. XII. REFUGES A.

WHOLESALE FISH DEALERS A. Tribally licensed wholesalers engaged solely in the purchase of fish from Tribal fishers are subject to the enforcement provisions of this Agreement. Any violations of regulations adopted by a Tribe to effectuate the terms of this Agreement by Tribally licensed wholesalers engaged solely in the purchase of fish from Tribal fishers shall be prosecuted exclusively in Tribal courts. B. The Tribes shall adopt and enforce regulations substantially similar to State regulations, requiring periodic reports and inspections from Tribally licensed fish wholesalers. C. Tribal wholesalers wishing to purchase fish from State licensees shall so indicate to Tribal authorities, who shall promptly notify the Department. The status of wholesalers so signifying shall be governed by applicable law, outside this Agreement. D. The Tribes agrees to provide the Department with records of Tribal licensed wholesalers on a case-by-case basis upon a showing of law enforcement need. E. Nothing herein is intended to prevent purchase of fish from State licensees by Tribal wholesalers. F. The purchase of fish from State licensees by a wholesaler who has not declared his intent to purchase from State licensees, shall be punishable by license suspension in addition to other penalties. A second violation shall be punished by a 30 day suspension, in addition to other penalties. XV. REPORTING A. The Parties shall require their commercial fishermen to file harvest reports for the periods ending the 15th and last day of each month, which include records of catch and effort by day and location by grid. The reports shall be required to be received by the appropriate management agency no later than the third working day following the reporting period. The Parties agree to provide each other a summary report showing effort by day by grid within 6 working days of the end of the month. B. The State is in the process of developing an electronic reporting system, applicable to State licensed commercial fishers. The Tribes agree to aid State in the development of the system, which may include a mobile application. Until such time as the Tribes adopt a similar system, the Tribes agree to require their licensed commercial fishers to keep an onboard daily log that includes estimated catch weights per species, to be completed each day of fishing prior to docking. C. The Tribes agree to provide the Department the daily effort records of individual fishermen on a case-by-case basis upon a showing of law enforcement need. XVI. STOCKING A. The Parties agree that stocking can be a tool used for reestablishing, rehabilitating, and maintaining species within the Lake Superior system. B. The Parties, through the Biological Committee, may discuss stocking strategies as needed. C. The State will remove no more than 300,000 lake trout eggs annually from the Gull Island refuge. XVII.

Violations by Tribal members shall be prosecuted exclusively in Tribal courts. C. Identification 1. At the beginning of each fishing year the Parties shall provide each other with a list of licensed fishermen and their license numbers. 2. State wardens may approach a Tribal fishing boat when necessary for the purpose of obtaining the identification of occupants of the boat, previously unknown to the wardens, who are apparently engaged in fishing activities. Tribal fishermen, upon showing of proper authority, shall stop and cooperate with such inquiries. 3. State wardens may similarly approach a Tribal fishing operation on the ice for the purpose of obtaining identification of persons, previously unknown to the wardens, apparently engaged in fishing activities. Tribal fishermen, upon showing of proper authority, shall cooperate with such inquiries. D. Inspections 1. The Tribes and their wardens shall have sole and exclusive authority to inspect Tribal fishermen, except as prescribed herein. 2. The Tribes agree that inspections are an important tool of law enforcement. The Tribes shall conduct at least 25 inspections per fishing year, in an effective, unannounced manner, with due consideration given to State recommendations and specific tips. The Tribes shall exchange inspection reports with the Department on a bimonthly basis, whether or not inspections are conducted during such period. 3. State wardens may on occasion, by agreement, accompany Tribal wardens during inspections and searches at landings and at sea. The Tribes shall allow at least 7 such inspections or searches during the fishing year. 4. The Tribes and State shall cooperate with each other's proposals to assure that these accompanied inspections and searches are carried out in a secure and unannounced manner. The Tribes will provide the State with schedules, telephone numbers, contact persons and other information to facilitate action on short notice, provided that action is consistent with Tribal guidelines on inspection hours and procedures and provided further that the State provide reciprocal information to the Tribes. 5. In addition to other penalties, a Tribal member's failure to allow an inspection or search authorized by this Agreement shall be punishable by license suspension. A second violation shall be punished by a suspension for not less than 30 fishing days. E. Searches 1. State wardens, having probable cause to believe that a Tribal fishing violation has occurred that day or is occurring on Lake Superior, may stop and contact the violators on the water in the following manner: a. Upon observing probable cause of the violation, State wardens shall immediately notify Tribal law enforcement authorities. Notice shall be given to the Tribe's designated representative, and shall include the nature of the suspected or observed violation and the location of the suspected violator(s) and State boat. b. State wardens shall use their best efforts to establish contact, including direct radio contact with the Tribe, radio and telephone contact through the sheriff's office or any other communications resource. A log shall be kept of all attempted contacts. c. State wardens may request permission from said suspected violator(s) to submit to a search of their vessel and its contents, provided that the State wardens, having probable cause of a violation, inform the suspected violator(s) of their reasons for believing that a violation has occurred and apprise the suspected violator(s) of their efforts to contact Tribal authorities. Suspects may refuse such search but shall then remain on site until a Tribal warden arrives to conduct an search. d. If State wardens cannot establish contact with Tribal law enforcement authorities within \u00bd hour, they shall apprise the suspected violator(s) of that fact and may then board and search the Tribal boat for evidence of a suspected violation. e. If the Tribal law enforcement boat can reach the location within 1 \u00bd hour of the time that notice is given, the suspected violator(s) and the State boat shall proceed in the direction of a rendezvous, or, if it is deemed essential to establish the locus, or the violator refuses to proceed, shall remain at the location until Tribal law enforcement arrives. f. Upon arrival of the Tribal law enforcement boat, boarding and search of the suspected violator(s)'s vessel shall be initiated by Tribal law enforcement authorities. State law enforcement officers may assist. g. If Tribal law enforcement authorities request and if the location of a Tribal boat in potential violation is within 2 hours of a suitable port, the suspected violator(s) will proceed to that location accompanied by the State boat. Boarding and search will occur as in Subparagraph f. above. h. Should Tribal law enforcement be unable to arrive within 1 \u00bd hour of notice of contact, or fail to arrive within 30 minutes of the violator's arrival in port pursuant to Subparagraph g. above, boarding and search by State wardens may take place as in Subparagraph d. above. i. Should a search be conducted under this Section, State wardens shall promptly provide the Tribe with a report summarizing the procedures and results of such search. 2. State wardens, having observed probable cause of a Tribal violation during fishing on the Lake Superior ice, and that evidence of a suspected violation is present, may conduct a search on the ice and seize evidence of the suspected violation, provided that they first inform the suspected violator(s) of their reasons for believing that a violation has occurred, and provided also that wardens are unable to contact and secure Tribal authorities to conduct the search. 3. State wardens, having probable cause to believe that a Tribal fishing violation has occurred, and that evidence of the violation is to be found in a Tribal fisher's vehicle off the reservation, may stop such vehicle, and thereafter conduct a search and seize evidence of a violation, provided that they first inform the suspected violator(s) of their reasons for believing that a violation has occurred, and provided also that the stop occurs at such distance and time of day that it is not feasible to contact and secure Tribal authorities to conduct the search or Tribal law enforcement declines to conduct the search. F. Seizures 1. The State may seize Tribal fishing gear set in areas closed to Tribal fishing pursuant to this Agreement. 2. In any search authorized by this Agreement, the State may seize all evidence of a suspected violation. 3. State wardens shall promptly notify Tribal authorities of a seizure and turn over the seized items to Tribal authorities. 4. Items seized for evidence shall be held by Tribal authorities where pertinent, except that fishing gear-shall be returned to Tribal fishermen upon stipulation as to ownership and physical description. 5. Fish seized and determined by the court to be contraband shall not be returned to the defendant, his agents or immediate family members. Should the fish be sold, the proceeds shall not be paid to the defendant, his agents or immediate family members. G. Exchange of Law Enforcement Information and Reports 1. In the interest of assuring the effective enforcement necessary for the success of the management plan, the Parties agree to promptly exchange incident reports and other information bearing on violations and the disposition of reported commercial fishing cases. 2. Upon receipt of an incident report from State wardens, Tribal authorities shall notify the State within 10 working days of whether a citation is to be issued. 3. Upon final disposition of such a case the Tribe shall notify the State of such disposition within 10 working days. 4. The Tribes shall provide State witnesses with notice of pertinent hearings and such witnesses shall cooperate in case development. 5. Upon receipt of an incident report from Tribal wardens involving non-tribal members, the State shall give the same notification as required of a Tribe in Paragraphs 2 and 3 above. 6. The Tribal attorney, or such other person as may be specifically designated, shall be responsible for providing the notification required in Paragraphs 2 and 3 above. Notification under Paragraph 5, and inquiries as to the current status of any case, shall be directed to this person. 7. The DNR staff attorney responsible for treaty fishing matters, or such other person as may be specifically designated, shall be responsible for providing the notification required under Paragraph 5. Notification under Paragraphs 2 and 3, and inquiries as to the status of any case, shall be directed to this person. 8. At least once a year, on the 1st of February, the persons designated in Paragraphs 6 and 7 above shall provide each other with summaries of all cases within the last calendar year in their respective jurisdictions dealing with Lake Superior fishing. 9. The intent of the Parties is to have joint patrols including both State and Tribal wardens become routine. In furtherance of this goal, Red Cliff agrees to make two wardens available for two days a week and Bad River agrees to make one warden available a minimum of one day a week, with additional days to be agreed upon between enforcement staffs. Department and Tribal wardens shall meet regularly and as frequently as necessary to establish and adjust patrol schedules. 10.
