                <p>WHEREAS the State of Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (hereafter referred to as the Department), the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians (hereafter referred to as the Bad River Tribe) and the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewas (hereafter referred to as the Red Cliff Tribe, and collectively as the Tribes) agree that the Lake Superior fishery is an important resource which must be carefully managed, and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS the Department and the Tribes agree that the management of the resource can best be handled on a cooperative basis, and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS the Department and the Tribes establish as a goal a healthy and diverse Lake Superior ecosystem that supports fish species at levels needed to sustain viable fisheries, managed holistically through sounds science that respects reserved treaty rights and ensures the beneficial uses by Tribal and non-tribal fishers, families and communities for future generations, and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS lake trout is the principal top predator in Lake Superior, the Parties agree that the goal is to maintain self-sustaining populations at or near carrying capacity, and</p>

                <p>WHEREAS after extensive negotiations the Department and the Tribes have agreed on a Comprehensive Plan for the cooperative management of the Lake Superior fishery, and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="V.A.">A.</span> The Parties agree that the Biological Committee shall, within three years, develop a lean lake trout model for WI-1 for consideration by Parties, with annual progress reports made during the annual meeting of the Parties. Until such time as the Parties agree to adopt a system for calculating the WI-1 quota, the annual lean lake trout quota for WI-1 shall be fixed at 14,500 lean lake trout.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="V.B.">B.</span> An annual lean lake trout quota for WI-2 shall be calculated every three years or as otherwise agreed to by the Parties using the Lake Trout Statistical Catch at Age Model.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="V.C.">C.</span> To confine the lean lake trout mortality to a 42% total annual mortality rate, the annual lean lake trout quota for WI-2 shall be established as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="V.C.1.">1.</span> The Parties agree to estimate a quota based on an annual mortality of 42%.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="V.C.2.">2.</span> Age-specific instantaneous commercial fishing mortality will be set so that total annual mortality will be 42% for the age most vulnerable to commercial harvest.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="V.C.3.">3.</span> The recommended quota will be the average total harvest (sport and commercial) predicted for the next 3 years, based on assumed mortality rates and projected lake trout abundance as projected by the SCAA model.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="V.D.">D.</span> Lean lake trout allocations shall be derived as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="V.D.1.">1.</span> The initial quotas for WI-1 and WI-2 shall first be reduced by the numbers needed for assessment (WI-1: 500 for State; WI-2: 1000 for State, 500 per Tribe).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="V.D.2.">2.</span> The remaining fish shall be divided equally between the State and the Tribes (combined).</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="V.D.4.">4.</span> At this time the Tribes have less need of an allocation in WI-1 and more of a need for an allocation in WI-2. Conversely, at this time the State has more of a need for an allocation in WI-1 and less of a need for an allocation in WI-2. Hence the Parties agree to a voluntary, nonprecedential exchange of fish between WI-1 and WI-2. Bad River shall annually retain 500 tags in WI-1 and in exchange for 3,000 additional tags in WI-2. Red Cliff shall annually retain 1,500 tags in WI-1 and in exchange for 2,000 additional tags in WI-2. The State's annual allocation in WI-1 shall increase by 5,000 and decrease in WI-2 by 5,000.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="V.D.5.">5.</span> The State further agrees to annually transfer 6,000 tags from its WI-2 allocation to the Tribes in exchange for reduced commercial fishing within the Van Tassell's Point Restricted Fishing Area. The Tribes agree that 3,000 of these tags shall be allocated to the Bad River Tribe and that 3,000 of these tags shall be allocated to the Red Cliff.</p>

Such systems shall further require lean lake trout harvested on open waters to be tagged, i.e., a tag affixed to the fish and securely locked, before docking, and lake trout harvested on the ice to be similarly tagged before being transported.</p>
