                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Termination of parental rights means that, pursuant to court order, all rights, powers, privileges, immunities, duties, and obligations existing between parent and child are permanently severed; however, tribal membership, rights, privileges, entitlements, or obligations shall not be affected by such termination.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Termination of parental rights may be ordered only in a proceeding where the petition clearly states that the petitioner is seeking an order of termination of parental rights, and where the mother and father have been summoned to appear before the Children's Court. No termination of the parental rights of an unadjudicated or unacknowledged father may be ordered without evidence and findings as to paternity of the child to the satisfaction of the court.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Involuntary Termination. Termination of parental rights may be ordered only in cases where the court finds that one or more of the following grounds exists:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> Abandonment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)(A)">(A)</span> The child has been left without provision for care or support and without reasonable expectation that a relative or other person would care for and support the child, and the petitioner has investigated and cannot locate the parent, or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)(B)">(B)</span> The child has been left by the parent with a relative or other person, or could reasonably expect that a relative or other person would provide for the child's care and support, or the child has been placed outside the parent's home by the order of a court of competent jurisdiction issued in a proceeding whereby the parent received either an oral or written warning that their parental rights may be terminated in subsequent proceedings, and in either case that the parent has failed to visit or communicate with the child for one year or longer, and that ninety days prior to the filing of the petition for termination of parental rights the parent was notified in a written notice to the parent's last known address that a petition would be filed; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> Failure to remedy condition. The child has been under the jurisdiction of court or courts of competent jurisdiction for at least one year and the parent has made no progress in remedying the conditions requiring jurisdiction or the child has been under the jurisdiction of court or courts of competent jurisdiction for at least two years and it is unlikely that the parent will remedy the conditions requiring jurisdiction, and in either case that at least ninety days prior to the filing of a termination of parental rights petition that parent was warned that a petition would be filed; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> Abuse. The child is under the jurisdiction of the court pursuant to <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/badriver/council/code/1.25.060#(a)(1)" title="">Section 1.25.060(a)(1)</a> and the Court finds that the facts establishing jurisdiction show a pattern of repeated or severe abuse; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(4)">(4)</span> Continuing denial of periods of physical placement. The parent has been denied all periods of physical placement or visitation rights by a court or courts of competent jurisdiction for a period of at least one year, the parent has been warned at least ninety days prior to the filing of a petition that a petition would be filed, and there is no currently pending action to modify the parent's physical placement or visitation rights in a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(5)">(5)</span> Failure to assume parental responsibility. The child is a non-marital child whose father has not subsequently adopted the child or married the child's mother and who has not established a substantial parental relationship with the child, meaning the acceptance and exercise of significant responsibilities for the daily supervision, education, protection, and care of the child, as evidenced by factors including but not limited to whether the father has ever expressed concern for or interest in the support, care, or well-being of the child or mother, and whether the father has neglected or refused to provide support.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Voluntary Termination. The court may terminate the parental rights of a parent who has given his or her informed, voluntary consent as provided in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/badriver/council/code/1.25.220" title="1.25.220 Termination of Parental Rights">this section</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> The parent appears personally at a hearing and gives his or her consent, the court explains the effect of a termination of parental rights, and the court has questioned the parent and found to its satisfaction that the consent is informed and voluntary.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> If the personal appearance of the parent before the court would be impossible or difficult, the court may accept written consent executed by the parent before an embassy or consular official, a military judge, or any judge of a court of record of another jurisdiction, and the consent is accompanied by the official's or judge's written findings that the parent was questioned and that the consent is informed and voluntary.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(3)">(3)</span> A person who may be but has not been adjudicated the father of a non marital child may consent as in (1) or (2) by signing a written, notarized statement that he has been informed of and understands the effect of a termination of parental rights and voluntarily disclaims any rights he may have to the child, including the right of notice of further proceedings under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/badriver/council/code/1.25" title="Chapter 1.25 Children's Code">this chapter</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(4)">(4)</span> If the proceeding to terminate parental rights is held prior to an adoption proceeding in which the petitioner is the child's stepparent, the parent may consent to termination of rights as provided in (1) or (2) or by filing with the court an affidavit witnessed by two persons stating that he or she has been informed of and understands the effect of an order to terminate parental rights, and that he or she voluntarily disclaims all rights to the child, including the right to notice of further proceedings under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/badriver/council/code/1.25" title="Chapter 1.25 Children's Code">this chapter</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(5)">(5)</span> Any minor parent stating an intent to consent to the termination of parental rights shall have a guardian ad litem appointed for him or her by the court. The minor parent's consent to terminate rights shall not be accepted unless joined by his or her guardian ad litem. The consent of the guardian ad litem shall preclude later attack on the validity of the consent on the grounds of incompetence or minority.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Petition.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> A petition for termination of parental rights may only be filed by a child's parent or by the child welfare coordinator.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> The petition commencing a proceeding for termination of parental rights shall set forth the following facts:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)(C)">(C)</span> A statement that consent to termination of parental rights will be given as provided by <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/badriver/council/code/1.25" title="Chapter 1.25 Children's Code">this chapter</a>, or a statement that consent will not be given, a statement of the specific grounds for involuntary termination under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/badriver/council/code/1.25" title="Chapter 1.25 Children's Code">this chapter</a>, and a statement of facts which petitioner alleges establish the grounds.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(4)">(4)</span> Advice that failure to respond or appear at the hearing may result in a termination of the party's parental rights.</p>

The published notice shall contain the following information:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(1)">(1)</span> An initial hearing shall be held on a petition to terminate parental rights no later than 30 days after the filing of the petition. At the hearing the court shall determine whether any party wishes to contest the petition and shall inform the parties of their rights under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/badriver/council/code/1.25.160#(c)" title="">Section 1.25.160(c)</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(2)">(2)</span> If the petition is contested the court shall set a date for a fact finding hearing no later than 45 days after the date of the initial hearing, unless all parties consent to an immediate hearing, in which case the court may immediately so proceed.</p>

If the court so finds, it shall proceed immediately to a dispositional hearing unless all parties agree to a delay or unless the report required in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/badriver/council/code/1.25.220#(j)" title="">Section 1.25.220(j)</a> has not been completed, in which case the court shall set a hearing date no later than 45 days after the fact-finding hearing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(2)">(2)</span> If disposition is delayed, the court may enter an interim disposition under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/badriver/council/code/1.25.180#(a)" title="">Section 1.25.180(a)</a>.</p>

The report shall include a description of efforts made to prevent removal of the child from the home and efforts made, if any, to return the child, and to remedy the conditions resulting in the termination proceeding. If the report recommends termination of both parents, or of the only living or known parent, the report shall include a statement of the child's likelihood of adoption, listing factors that might prevent it and factors that might facilitate it, and the interim plan and designated guardian recommended pending adoption. The report shall also contain a medical and genetic history of the child and birth parents on a form as provided by the Wisconsin Department of Health and Social Services.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(2)">(2)</span> Court considerations.

                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(2)(B)(i)">(i)</span> The age and health of the child, both at the time of the disposition and, if applicable, at the time the child was removed from the home,</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(2)(B)(ii)">(ii)</span> The wishes of the child,</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(2)(B)(iv)">(iv)</span> Whether the child will be able to enter into a more stable and permanent family relationship as a result of the termination, taking into account the conditions of the child's current placement, the likelihood of future placements and the results of prior placements.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(3)">(3)</span> Any party may present evidence relevant to disposition, and propose alternative dispositions. The court shall order either disposition listed below no later than ten days after a hearing on disposition.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(4)">(4)</span> Upon a finding that grounds exist for a termination of parental rights the court shall order one of the following dispositions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(4)(A)">(A)</span> The court may dismiss the petition.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(4)(B)">(B)</span> The court may order the termination of parental rights of one or both parents.
