At the same time, the Committee shall report to the Tribal Council the list of names of individuals not recommended for inclusion on the ballot. The two lists shall together include the names of all individuals who submitted completed applications by the deadline stated in subsection (i)(1) for that year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(4)">(4)</span> the Enrollment Clerk shall post the list of names approved by the Tribal Council for inclusion on the election ballot no less than sixty days prior to the election.</p>

Such notification shall be mailed no later than the date specified in subsection (i)(3). Any individual may appeal the Committee's recommendation, and seek Tribal Council inclusion on the adoption ballot, by filing a written notice of such appeal with both the Membership Committee and the Tribal Council. The individual shall be allowed to appear at any Tribal Council meeting scheduled prior to the deadline specified in subsection (i)(4) and present his or her case for Tribal Council decision. If no Tribal Council meeting is scheduled prior to the deadline specified in subsection (i)(4), the individual may demand the scheduling of a meeting upon payment of a meeting fee equal to the sum of the meeting stipends to which the Council members would be entitled for attending the meeting. The individual may, in the alternative, demand to be heard at a later scheduled meeting, in which case if the Tribal Council finds in the individual's favor his or her name will be placed on the adoption ballot for the subsequent year.</p>
