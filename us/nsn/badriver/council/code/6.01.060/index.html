The individual shall be allowed to appear at any Tribal Council meeting scheduled prior to the deadline specified in subsection (i)(4) and present his or her case for Tribal Council decision. If no Tribal Council meeting is scheduled prior to the deadline specified in subsection (i)(4), the individual may demand the scheduling of a meeting upon payment of a meeting fee equal to the sum of the meeting stipends to which the Council members would be entitled for attending the meeting. The individual may, in the alternative, demand to be heard at a later scheduled meeting, in which case if the Tribal Council finds in the individual's favor his or her name will be placed on the adoption ballot for the subsequent year.</p>
