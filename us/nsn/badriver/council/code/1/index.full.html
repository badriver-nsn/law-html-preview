                  <p>Subsection (b) establishes the authority of the Court of Appeals to review the constitutionality of Tribal Council acts of whatever nature. Because tribal constitutions do not typically provide for a separation of powers between the judiciary and the other functions of the government, some question may be raised as to the implicit authority of the courts to review the acts of tribal government. Whatever the correct answer is to that question, this subsection delegates whatever authority is necessary to perform such review.</p>

In cases involving multiple parties, an order or judgment may dispose of all issues between two or more of the parties, and would therefore be appealable. In cases involving multiple issues, an order disposing of one or more issues may leave others as yet unresolved and would therefore not be appealable.</p>

                  <h4>Commentary</h4>
                  <p>The appeal is started by filing the notice of appeal, a simple form for which a model is provided as Official Form no. 1.

                  <p>The essence of the notice of appeal is to give fair notice to the other parties that what would otherwise be a final disposition of a case will not be final, and to allow the other parties to begin preparation for responding to the appeal or for filing a cross-appeal. The notice of appeal provided for in this section also requires a statement of the grounds for appeal and the relief sought, in the event an appellant appearing pro Se elects not to file a brief. Any party including in the notice of appeal the items listed in this subsection will be deemed to have clearly identified the matter appealed. A notice of appeal that fails to include all of the items listed in this subsection may cause the Court to expand the time for response, dismiss the appeal, or make other appropriate orders.</p>

                  <p>The above rules are considered the minimum necessary for allowing the Court of Appeals to conduct its business in an efficient and just fashion. Briefing rules are purposely looser than in other jurisdictions to allow non-lawyers to represent themselves, or if otherwise permitted by the rules of the Tribal Court (see <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/badriver/council/code/1.21.200" title="1.21.200 Practice Before the Court of Appeals">sec. 1.21.200</a>), to represent others. Briefs are made optional, in recognition that some parties appearing pro Se may not wish to file briefs but may rather wish to present their cases solely in oral argument. The notice of appeal (see <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/badriver/council/code/1.21.100#(a)" title="">Sec. 1.21.100(a)</a>) accordingly requires a short statement of the grounds for appeal and of the relief sought.

                  <h4>Commentary</h4>
                  <p>The standard of review defines the relationship between the trial court and the appeals court. The standard of review seeks to allocate to each court that part of the judicial work which it can best do. The trial court is in the best position to weigh the evidence and assess witness credibility and is therefore sustained on such matters unless its findings are clearly erroneous. The trial court is in no better position to interpret the law than the appeals court; in fact, the appeals court has the luxury of being able to analyze the law away from the heat of trial and can better perform this task itself. The appeals court can therefore look at questions of law afresh and need not defer at all to the trial court. Discretionary questions by their nature, can result in different decisions when put to different decision makers. The function of the appeals court in reviewing a discretionary decision is not to itself decide the result it would choose, but to determine whether the trial court in fact exercised discretion and made a decision based on the applicable facts and law. The exercise of discretion is more than bald decision making and it is the task of the appeals court to see that the appropriate process was followed.</p>
                  <p>Specific instances of common standard of review problems are listed in this section; for instance the definition of sentencing as a discretionary determination. These instances are not exclusive. The Tribal Council may provide by ordinance and the courts by decision the classification of other matters as factual, legal, or discretionary.</p>

                  <h4>Commentary</h4>
                  <p>Subsections (a) and (d) preserve the basic function of the appeals court as a court of review, not a court of initial determination. The trial court should have the first opportunity to consider all issues in litigation and to see as only it can do that the record is fully developed.</p>
                  <p>Subsection (b) protects the court and parties from expending energy on issues that an appellant has no intention of pursuing.</p>
                  <p>Subsection (c) states the principle that a court will not decide issues over which there is no current controversy. The controversy that existed during trial may be dispelled by the time of appeal. The exception to this rule is the type of case that may occur again but is likely never to survive long enough to receive appellate review. For instance, an individual may wish to challenge a court's suspension of his hunting and fishing rights for a period of three months, but by the completion of the appellate briefing schedule the suspension would be ended and the case moot. Since the issue could recur, but would always become moot before it was ready for decision, the mootness doctrine would be set aside.</p>

If a tenant unjustifiably removes from the premises prior to the effective date for termination of his tenancy and defaults in payment of rent, or if the tenant is removed for failure to pay rent or any other breach of a lease, the landlord can recover rent and damages except amounts which he could mitigate in accordance with <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/badriver/council/code/1.24.180" title="1.24.180 Recovery of Rent and Damages by Landlord; Mitigation">this section</a>, unless he has expressly agreed to accept a surrender of the premises and end the tenant's liability.

In any claim against a tenant for rent and damages, or for either, the amount of recovery is reduced by the net rent obtainable by reasonable efforts to re- rent the premises. Reasonable efforts mean those steps which the landlord would have taken to rent the premises if they had been vacated in due course, provided that such steps are in accordance with local rental practice for similar properties. In the absence of proof that greater net rent is obtainable by reasonable efforts to re-rent the premises, the tenant is credited with rent actually received under a re-rental agreement minus expenses incurred as a reasonable incident of acts under sub. (d), including a fair proportion of any cost of remodeling or other capital improvements. In any case the landlord can recover, in addition to rent other elements of damage, all reasonable expenses of listing and advertising incurred in re-renting and attempting to re-rent (except as taken into account in computing the net rent under preceding sentence). If the landlord has used the premises as part of reasonable efforts to re-rent, under sub.(4)(c), the tenant is credited with the reasonable value of the use of the premises, which is presumed to be equal to the rent recoverable from the defendant unless the landlord proves otherwise. If the landlord has other similar premises for rent and receives an offer from a prospective tenant not obtained by the defendant, it is reasonable for the landlord to rent the other premises for his own account in preference to those vacated by the defaulting tenant.</p>

The tenant has the burden of proving that the efforts of the landlord were not reasonable, that the landlord's refusal of any offer to rent the premises or a part thereof was not reasonable, that any terms and conditions upon which the landlord has in fact re-rented were not reasonable, and that any temporary use by the landlord was not part of reasonable efforts to mitigate in accordance with sub.

                <p>Children are the most important asset of the Bad River Tribe. In them lie the Tribe's future, and in their retention of Chippewa culture lies the preservation of the Tribe's past. Their health, safety, and welfare are paramount to the Tribe. It is the policy of the Tribe to strengthen family structures, to prevent family breakups, and to foster conditions favorable to the growth, spirit, culture, and individuality of each child. A child without knowledge of the past is directionless in the path forward; a child without a nurturing present is denied the strengths that lead to the future. It is the Tribe's policy to favor preventive action over belated reaction, mediation over confrontation, counseling over lecturing, conciliation over punishment - but in all decisions made under this code the welfare of the child shall be the ultimate touchstone.</p>
