                <p>The Tribal Council finds that the lands now comprising the Bad River Reservation were traditional hunting grounds for the ancestors of the Tribe; that these lands were selected as a Reservation because of their wealth of fish, game, and wild rice; that deer have been a nutritional staple for members of the Tribe for generations beyond memory; that deer continue to provide a substantial portion of the protein and other nutritional needs of the Tribe's members; that high unemployment and cash-poor local economy indicate that deer will remain critical as a food source for the Tribe's members; that pressure on the deer population by non-member sport hunting reduces the availability of deer as a food source for members; that non-members flaunting of tribal conservation laws has contributed to a decline in the reservation deer population; and that effective regulation of both member and non-member hunting of deer is essential for the preservation of the species in numbers sufficient to supply the economic and nutritional needs of the Tribe's members.</p>

                <p>The Tribal Council finds that the lands now comprising the Bad River Reservation were traditional hunting and fishing grounds for the ancestors of the Tribe; that those lands were selected as a Reservation because of their wealth of fish, game and wild rice; that walleye have been a nutritional staple for members of the Tribe for generations beyond memory; that walleye continue to provide a substantial portion of the protein and other nutritional needs of the Tribe's members; that high unemployment and a cash-poor local economy indicate that walleye will remain critical as a food source for the Tribe's members; that pressure on the walleye population by non-member sport fishing reduces the availability of walleye as a food source for members; that the stocking activities of the Tribe's fish hatchery have contributed significantly over the last several years to the reservation walleye population; that non-member flaunting of tribal conservation laws have contributed to a decline in the reservation walleye population; and that effective regulation of both member and non-member taking of walleye is essential for the preservation of the species in numbers sufficient to supply the economic and nutritional needs of the Tribe's members.</p>

                <p>The Tribal Council finds that the lands now comprising the Bad River Reservation were traditional hunting, fishing, and gathering grounds for the ancestors of the Tribe; that these lands were selected as a Reservation because of their wealth of fish, game, and wild rice; that wild rice has been a nutritional staple for members of the Tribe for generations beyond memory; that wild rice continues to provide a substantial portion of the protein and other nutritional needs of the Tribe's members; that the annual harvest of wild rice is a traditional event of long-standing cultural importance; that high unemployment and cash-poor local economy indicate that wild rice will remain critical as a food source for the Tribe's members; that one predictable source of cash income for the Tribe's members is the sale of wild rice to non-residents of the reservation; and that effective regulation of both member and non-member harvesting of wild rice is essential for the preservation of wild rice in amounts sufficient to supply the economic, nutritional, and cultural needs of the Tribe's members.</p>

                <p>The Bad River Tribal Council finds that wetlands and watercourses are fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands provide important tribal/public benefits and ecological functions. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation, water quality maintenance and pollution control, flood control, shoreline erosion control, natural resource education, scientific study, open space, recreation opportunities, environmental niches, and most importantly the traditional, cultural, and spiritual aspects of our heritage.</p>
                <p>Previous construction, land development, and other impacts have displaced, polluted, or degraded many wetlands and forested flood plains. Piecemeal or cumulative losses continue to threaten the remaining wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens the public safety, health and general welfare of the Band. Preservation of the wetlands in a natural condition is necessary to maintain hydrologic, economic, recreational, subsistence, cultural, spiritual and aesthetic assets for current and future residents of the Bad River Reservation.</p>
                <p>It is therefore necessary for the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians (Bad River Tribe) to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities in wetlands and activities at adjacent upland sites that may adversely affect wetlands,</p>

                <p>It is the policy of the Bad River Tribe to require planning to avoid or minimize damage to wetlands; to require that activities not dependent upon wetland location be located at upland sites; to allow wetland losses only where all practical measures to avoid and minimize have been applied; to reduce losses from activities that are unavoidable and in the public interest; and to provide for the protection of wetlands under existing and additional ordinances adopted by the Tribe including management regulations, storm water management regulations, floodplain zoning; and to establish standards and procedures for the review and regulation of the use of wetlands and watercourses and the establishment of penalties for the violation of this ordinance.</p>

The wetlands map shall serve as a general guide for the delineation of wetland boundaries. Field investigations to delineate the precise boundaries of wetlands on a project site shall be the responsibility of the applicant. In cases where the Bad River Tribe needs additional information to complete a permit application review, the Bad River Natural Resources Department may complete on site investigations of protected wetlands and watercourses at the expense of the applicant or require the applicant to provide such information.</p>
                <p>The Wetland Inventory Map shows only the general location of wetlands. The map should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. The Wetland Inventory Map together with an explanatory letter is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance.

                <p>Such proposal may involve a monetary compensation fee as provided for in this ordinance for the creation or restoration of an "out of kind" and "off site" high quality wetland mitigation banking strategy. In the case of tribally designated projects located within the development corridor, mitigation by preservation will be an option at select preservation sites within the Bad River Tribe's Integrated Resource Management Plan conservation and restoration areas or other areas that would contribute to protection of the aquatic environment based on a holistic watershed approach.</p>

                <p>This Code is enacted pursuant to the Tribe's inherent sovereign authority. The Tribe has a primary interest in the protection, control, conservation, and utilization of Reservation Waters, as exemplified in the <a class="internal-link " href="/us/nsn/badriver/council/constitution" title="Constitution of the Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians of the State of Wisconsin.">Bad River Constitution</a> and recognized by EPA when it granted the Tribe's application for treatment-as-state authority to develop and implement the Tribe's Water Quality Standards. The program authority granted by EPA is in addition to the Tribe's historic hunting, fishing, gathering, and usufructuary rights and its treaty rights. This Code shall not be construed to annul those independent Tribal rights, including the right to sufficient quantities and quality of water to support the flora, fauna, and cultural traditions of the Tribe.</p>

                <p>Protecting the Reservation Waters is a primary goal of the Tribe. Water pollution endangers the health and welfare of Tribal members and residents of the Reservation. This Code establishes procedures and standards for the review of applications for Tribal Water Quality Certifications under CWA Section 401(a)(1), Tribal Water Quality Reviews under CWA Section 401(a)(2), and Tribal Water Quality Reviews of proposed federal and state permits that may affect the waters of the Bad River Reservation.

                <p>The Tribal Council finds that the fisheries of the Bad River Tribe, both on the reservation and in Lake Superior, constitute important communal resources possessed by the Tribe as a whole. The Bad River Tribe has a long history of lake and river fishing and a long history of respect for the fish its members pursue. Both before and after the treaty era, Bad River members fished for subsistence, consuming some of the fish they caught, and selling, on a subsistence level, others. Tribal members have also fished for market on a commercial scale, and the time is not so far past when commercial fishing wharves lined the Bad River at Old Odanah, home port to member-owned fishing steamers.</p>
                <p>The Tribe's interests in the fish of the reservation and of the Lake continue to today. Today's interest is to see that the fish populations survive for harvest tomorrow, and into generations yet unseen. The Tribe's interest is also to provide a source of subsistence - for home use consumption and also for small scale market activity - to its members. Finally, the Tribe's interest is to provide a stable, protected source for the livelihood of those of its members who pursue the Lake's fish on a commercial scale.</p>
                <p>To meet these interests, the Tribe has embarked on a cooperative management program with the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewas and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. It is only through the joint efforts of the three sovereigns with rights in the Lakes' resources that effective regulation and equitable sharing of the resource can be achieved. <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/badriver/council/code/3.13" title="Chapter 3.13 Commercial Fishing Regulations">This chapter</a> is therefore promulgated.</p>
