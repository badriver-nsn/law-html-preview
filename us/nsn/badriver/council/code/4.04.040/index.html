                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(4)">(4)</span> A copy of the approved plan shall be available at the construction site until completion of the private sewage system.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(5)">(5)</span> A final "as built" copy of the plans shall be submitted to the POWTS Inspector and kept in a permanent file for the system.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(6)">(6)</span> A modification to the design of the private sewage system which has previously been approved shall be submitted to the POWTS Inspector. Plan revisions must be approved before revision construction begins. Only modifications which affect the treatment of the sewage/effluent (such as downsizing the mound, change in loading rate, any additional pretreatment such as an aerator in the tank) shall require plan revision. Revision is not required for modifications that do not alter the original area, dimensions or concept of the system.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(j)">(j)</span> Transfer of Ownership. In order to ensure the provisions of this Ordinance are complied with, upon transfer of ownership of a property for which a valid sanitary permit exists, the following shall apply:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(1)">(1)</span> Any person transferring, selling, or conveying a building or dwelling, or land upon which a building or dwelling is located, shall report such transfer, sale, or conveyance fifteen (15) days prior to said transfer, sale or conveyance to the POWTS Inspector. Reporting shall be by such person, such person's agent, or any real estate agent.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(2)">(2)</span> Prior to such transfer, sale or conveyance of any building or dwelling, the transferor, seller or conveyer shall have conducted an evaluation of the existing private waste disposal system, if said structure is served by the same. An evaluation of the private waste disposal system shall be done by the POWTS Inspector or any other person certified as a POWTS maintainer, inspector, and soil tester (all inclusive). Evaluation shall be conducted in accordance with and on forms furnished by the POWTS Inspector. All evaluations shall be submitted to the POWTS Inspector for review. The POWTS Inspector is empowered to investigate any system so evaluated.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(3)">(3)</span> If, upon inspection, the existing system meets the criteria of a "failing private sewage system" as defined in this Ordinance or WSA Sec. 145.245(4), an order for replacement is issued under this Ordinance or WSA Sec. 145.20(2)(e), (f), and (g), said new system shall be installed within one year of the sale or conveyance date by the transferee unless by written agreement the transferor has retained the obligation to replace the system. Any such agreement shall be filed with the POWTS Inspector and shall be enforceable by the POWTS Inspector against the transferor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(4)">(4)</span> The following changes in ownership shall require an inspection: Gifts through addition of another person to ownership, unless the last inspection was completed within twenty-four (24) months of the transaction; addition of children to a deed; transfer to an irrevocable trust; land contracts; addition of a name to property owners, except between spouses; proposed transfers which fall through, dating from the original transfer notification requirement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(5)">(5)</span> The following changes in interest shall not require an inspection at the time of transfer: life estates until the transferor is divested of all rights of ownership; transfer of marital estate between spouse, except transfer of individually classified property from one spouse to another; transfer of property to or from a revocable living trust; a lease-option until the option is exercised; subtraction of a name from ownership; a transfer within twenty-four (24) months of a passing inspection, at the discretion of the POWTS Inspector.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(6)">(6)</span> The sanitary permit shall be returned to the POWTS Inspector so that a new permit may be issued noting the new property holder;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(7)">(7)</span> Because the permit runs with the property, transfer of property shall not affect the expiration date unless a renewal is also requested; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(8)">(8)</span> A transfer filing fee of the correct amount as listed in Exhibit A shall be paid at the time of filing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(k)">(k)</span> Change of Plumbers.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(k)(1)">(1)</span> When an owner wishes to change plumbers during construction, it will be necessary for him to furnish the POWTS Inspector with the applicable change form signed by the new plumber. New plans must also be submitted by the plumber, designer, or engineer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(k)(2)">(2)</span> The transfer of a sanitary permit shall take place prior to the installation of the private sewage system.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(k)(3)">(3)</span> A transfer filing fee of the correct amount as listed in Exhibit A shall be paid at the time filing.</p>
