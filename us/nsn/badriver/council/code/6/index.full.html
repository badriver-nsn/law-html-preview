For the purposes of this Chapter, the term "legal custody" means the custody awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction. Any documentary evidence provided as proof of legal custody or guardianship must be in the form of originals or certified copies. Proof of parenthood alone, without proof of legal custody or guardianship, will not authorize a person to request relinquishment on behalf of a tribal member who is under the age of eighteen (18) years.</p>

If a parent making a request for relinquishment on behalf of a child does not have sole custody of such child, such parent must demonstrate that he/she has joint custody of the child, and a notarized statement from the other parent joining in the request for relinquishment must be provided to the Enrollment Office. Certified copies of the divorce decree or order of separation, and of the order granting custody, must be submitted to the Enrollment Office.</p>

No benefits associated with membership in the Tribe shall be granted to such person for the period of time during which he/she was not enrolled in the Tribe. Any tribal member whose membership is challenged under subsection (a), (b), or (c) shall have a right to be heard by the Membership Committee, which shall determine if there is sufficient evidence to believe that the tribal member should be disenrolled. If the Committee so finds it shall present its evidence and recommendation to the Tribal Council which shall decide whether the tribal member shall be disenrolled.</p>
