The administrator shall make lease site application forms available to any tribal member seeking a residential lease. An applicant seeking a residential lease site shall complete an application on the form provided him by the administrator. The applicant may list in order of priority up to three desired lease sites. The applicant shall describe the lease sites as completely as possible and shall include a legal description if available. If necessary for adequate identification the administrator shall make a visit with the applicant to the proposed lease sites.</p>

The administrator shall check the proposed lease site against the Official Zoning Map, the Official Lease Map, and the Official Forestry Map, and shall verify on the application that the site is tribal property, is not otherwise leased, is within a residential district, is independent of shoreland/wetland restrictions, and is outside the boundaries of any forestry development project. If the site is encroached by shoreland/wetland restrictions but is partially usable for residential site, the administrator shall so note on the application and inform the applicant. The applicant may then choose to have the administrator continue the certification process of the site so encroached, or may request the administrator to proceed with the certification process on an alternate site.</p>

If the site is within a 100 year flood plain the administrator shall so note on the application and inform the applicant. The applicant may then choose to have the administer continue the certification process of the site or may request the administrator to proceed with the certification process on an alternate site. If the applicant directs the administrator to proceed with the certification process of the flood plain site, the applicant shall sign a statement declaring that he is aware that he will be ineligible for tribal or Indian Health Service assistance in the installation of sewer and water facilities. The site shall not, however, be denied certification solely because it is within a 100 year flood plain.</p>

The administrator shall submit to the tribal council for approval the completed lease application, the lease prepared by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and a draft resolution approving the lease. If the Tribal Council approves the lease resolution, the administrator shall submit all necessary papers to the Bureau of Indian Affairs for execution and recording.</p>

Any denial of lease-site certification made by the administrator may be appealed to the Tribal Council by submitting to the Council the lease application, the administrator's denial of certification and a statement of reasons why the denial should be overridden. The Council in determining any appeal shall apply the provisions of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/badriver/council/code/4.02" title="Chapter 4.02 Tribal Leases">this chapter</a> and Chapters 401 and 402. For purposes of appeal any failure by the administrator to certify or to proceed further in the certification process because of a 403.7(c) conflict or 403.7(e) failure shall be construed as a denial.</p>

                <p>The Bad River Tribal Council recognizes that the land within its jurisdiction represents a unique confluence of cultural, historical, and environmental resources. Home to the ancestors of the Bad River Band for over three centuries, the land is an irreplaceable habitat for the wealth of fish, waterfowl, and mammal life from which the Chippewa Indians have traditionally derived their sustenance. Where the rivers widen, wild rice stands stretch out to the high ground and down to the Lake, and contribute to a delicate ecosystem about with life. Upstream, the Bad River Falls are the site of pictographs created by the ancestors of those Indians who still fish the Falls today. Throughout the territory traditional burial grounds are scattered, spiritual wellsprings of the Bad River Band and visible reminders of the Band's ancient attachment to the area now known as the Bad River Reservation.</p>
                <p>Reminders of man's more recent and continuing impact on the land are also visible. Wrought by tribal members and non-members alike, sometimes beneficial to the Bad River Band and sometimes not, sometimes in harmony with the land and sometimes not, these artifacts are lasting mementos of man's presence. Timber sites, roads, utility rights-of-way, government buildings, stores, houses, taverns, motels, hunting shacks, quarries, dumps, mills - all have left a mark of more or less permanence whether appropriately placed and productively used or not.</p>
                <p>The Bad River Tribal Council, aware of its responsibility to guard for future generations the enjoyment of the resources that so many past generations of Chippewa Indians have enjoyed, is equally aware of increasing pressures on those resources. The demand for wooded and shoreline land is rapidly growing, as greater numbers of the general population seek sites for homes, vacation sites, and commercial development. Meanwhile the Bad River Band seeks an improved economic base to establish the financial security of itself and its members.</p>
                <p>In limited areas the Band currently has the capability of controlling development. Tribal members have requested leases of tribal land in delicate areas to establish home sites for their families. The Council has denied these leases and by doing so has preserved these lands, to the immediate detriment of some tribal members.</p>
                <p>The Council cannot, however, control the development of the reservation solely in its capacity as lessor. Regrettably, through the unwise actions of the United States government in previous years, much of the Reservation lands are no longer in tribal hands. Either as restricted allotments or as fee-title land, this property is beyond the proprietary control of the Band. Only through the exercise of the Band's regulatory authority can the majority of Reservation lands be subject to controlled, planned development, to the mutual reciprocal benefit of all.</p>
                <p>The development of a land use plan, encompassing the 125,000 acres that constitute the Bad River Reservation, cannot spring full-blown overnight. On the other hand, developmental pressures will not cease while the Council deliberates. In order therefore to forestall any action which may limit the Band's regulatory prerogatives, in order to notify those with an interest in any Reservation lands that a comprehensive land use plan is under consideration, in order to establish a process for the creation of such a plan, and in order to establish interim controls pending the approval of such a plan, this ordinance is adopted.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="/us/nsn/badriver/council/code/4.08.010#(a)">(a)</span> The idea of water conservation ordinance focusing on low-flow plumbing fixtures is to encourage water conservation at the tap by requiring all new construction and repair or renovation of existing building to utilize low-flow plumbing fixtures, such as low-flow faucets, washing machines and dishwashers, and toilets.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="/us/nsn/badriver/council/code/4.08.010#(b)">(b)</span> Water quality is of paramount concern to the Tribe. Reduction in water use is necessary to ensure that the Tribe's wastewater treatment facilities are able to function without threat of overload and to prevent overloads of private or individual sewerage systems such as septic systems and holding tanks. Most water coming from the tap goes directly down the drain. Because no distinction can be made between clean, "gray" or "black" water, all of the water becomes "black" and must be treated. Although the water meets strict effluent standards, it is not as "pure" as the water originally came out of the tap. The Tribe's wastewater treatment facilities are also limited in the amount of flow they can adequately treat, as are septic systems. Too much water can cause these systems to fail to meet effluent standards. Holding tanks are limited in capacity and must be pumped out. The material pumped out must then be treated in some system. By reducing the amount of water coming out of the faucet, individuals can reduce the amount of clean water entering the waste treatment system, and, consequently, help maintain or improve the quality of the Tribe's water system.</p>
