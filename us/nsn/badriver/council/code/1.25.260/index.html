                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Guiding Philosophy for Customary Adoption</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> It is the fundamental belief of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians that its children are the sacred responsibility of the Tribe.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> One of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa’s basic inherent sovereign rights is the right to make decisions regarding the best interests of its children including who should provide for the care, custody and control of its children. <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/badriver/council/code/1.25.260" title="1.25.260 Customary Adoption">This Section</a> is intended to assure a safe, stable, nurturing, and permanent environment for the tribe’s children and to provide for the protection of our children, our people, and our way of life.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> The principles that shall guide decisions pursuant to this code are: protection of the child’s safety, well-being and welfare and their sense of belonging; preservation of the child’s identity as a tribal member and member of an extended family and clan; preservation of the culture, religion, language, values, clan system and relationships of the Tribe.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span> As an exercise of its inherent sovereignty the Bad River Band has the authority and jurisdiction to formally delegate the authority of its Children’s Court to adjudicate its own customary practices regarding child rearing and child custody.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Purpose of Customary Adoption</p>
                <p><a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/badriver/council/code/1.25.260" title="1.25.260 Customary Adoption">Section 1.25.260</a>, Customary Adoption, shall be liberally interpreted and construed as an exercise of the inherent sovereign authority of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa to fulfill the following express purposes:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> To embody and promote the basic traditional values of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa regarding the protection and care of the tribe’s children. The Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa believes that it is the responsibility of the tribe, the tribal communities and extended families to protect, care for, and nurture our children.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> To promote the belief of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa that children deserve a sense of permanency and belonging throughout their lives and at the same time they deserve to have knowledge about their unique cultural heritage including their tribal customs, history, language, religion, and values.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> To provide for the best interests of the tribe, tribal communities and the tribe's children.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)(4)">(4)</span> To afford judicial processes which allow for formal adjudications that address the issues of the rights, responsibilities, care, custody and control of minor children when the biological parents are unable or unwilling to provide a safe, stable, nurturing and permanent environment for their children by conferring jurisdiction upon the Bad River Children’s Court to hear and adjudicate such matters.</p>
