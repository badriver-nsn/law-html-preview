                <p>Any unused portion of fish reserved for home use under Section 325.13, can be reallocated to the commercial component of the fishery no later than August 1. When and if home use fish are reallocated to the commercial fishery, a sum of 100 fish will be retained from the available balance for home use activity during the remainder of the quota year. The following formula will be used to calculate effort limitations for utilization of reallocated home use fish.</p>
