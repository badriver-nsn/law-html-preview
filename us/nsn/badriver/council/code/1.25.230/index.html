                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Termination of parental rights means that, pursuant to court order, all rights, powers, privileges, immunities, duties, and obligations existing between parent and child are permanently severed; however, tribal membership, rights, privileges, entitlements, or obligations shall not be affected by such termination.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Termination of parental rights may be ordered only in a proceeding where the petition clearly states that the petitioner is seeking an order of termination of parental rights, and where the mother and father have been summoned to appear before the Children's Court. No termination of the parental rights of an unadjudicated or unacknowledged father may be ordered without evidence and findings as to paternity of the child to the satisfaction of the court.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Suspension of Parental Rights means that pursuant to court order, all rights, powers, privileges, immunities, duties, and obligations existing between parent and child are suspended as agreed by biological parent; however tribal membership, rights, privileges, entitlements, or obligations shall not be affected by such suspension for the child(ren).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Involuntary Termination. Termination of parental rights may be ordered only in cases where the court finds that one or more of the following grounds exists:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> Abandonment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)(A)">(A)</span> The child has been left without provision for care or support and without reasonable expectation that a relative or other person would care for and support the child, and the petitioner has investigated and cannot locate the parent, or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)(B)">(B)</span> The child has been left by the parent with a relative or other person, or could reasonably expect that a relative or other person would provide for the child's care and support, or the child has been placed outside the parent's home by the order of a court of competent jurisdiction issued in a proceeding whereby the parent received either an oral or written warning that their parental rights may be terminated in subsequent proceedings, and in either case that the parent has failed to visit or communicate with the child for one year or longer, and that ninety days prior to the filing of the petition for termination of parental rights the parent was notified in a written notice to the parent's last known address that a petition would be filed; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> Failure to remedy condition. The child has been under the jurisdiction of court or courts of competent jurisdiction for at least one year and the parent has made no progress in remedying the conditions requiring jurisdiction or the child has been under the jurisdiction of court or courts of competent jurisdiction for at least two years and it is unlikely that the parent will remedy the conditions requiring jurisdiction, and in either case that at least ninety days prior to the filing of a termination of parental rights petition that parent was warned that a petition would be filed; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(3)">(3)</span> Abuse. The child is under the jurisdiction of the court pursuant to <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/badriver/council/code/1.25.060#(a)(1)" title="">Section 1.25.060(a)(1)</a> and the Court finds that the facts establishing jurisdiction show a pattern of repeated or severe abuse; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(4)">(4)</span> Continuing denial of periods of physical placement. The parent has been denied all periods of physical placement or visitation rights by a court or courts of competent jurisdiction for a period of at least one year, the parent has been warned at least ninety days prior to the filing of a petition that a petition would be filed, and there is no currently pending action to modify the parent's physical placement or visitation rights in a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(5)">(5)</span> Failure to assume parental responsibility. The child is a non-marital child whose father has not subsequently adopted the child or married the child's mother and who has not established a substantial parental relationship with the child, meaning the acceptance and exercise of significant responsibilities for the daily supervision, education, protection, and care of the child, as evidenced by factors including but not limited to whether the father has ever expressed concern for or interest in the support, care, or well-being of the child or mother, and whether the father has neglected or refused to provide support.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Voluntary Termination. The court may terminate the parental rights of a parent who has given his or her informed, voluntary consent as provided in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/badriver/council/code/1.25.230" title="1.25.230 Termination or Suspensiont of Parental Rights">this section</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> The parent appears personally at a hearing and gives his or her consent, the court explains the effect of a termination of parental rights, and the court has questioned the parent and found to its satisfaction that the consent is informed and voluntary.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> If the personal appearance of the parent before the court would be impossible or difficult, the court may accept written consent executed by the parent before an embassy or consular official, a military judge, or any judge of a court of record of another jurisdiction, and the consent is accompanied by the official's or judge's written findings that the parent was questioned and that the consent is informed and voluntary.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(3)">(3)</span> A person who may be but has not been adjudicated the father of a non marital child may consent as in (1) or (2) by signing a written, notarized statement that he has been informed of and understands the effect of a termination of parental rights and voluntarily disclaims any rights he may have to the child, including the right of notice of further proceedings under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/badriver/council/code/1.25" title="Chapter 1.25 Children's Code">this chapter</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(4)">(4)</span> If the proceeding to terminate parental rights is held prior to an adoption proceeding in which the petitioner is the child's stepparent, the parent may consent to termination of rights as provided in (1) or (2) or by filing with the court an affidavit witnessed by two persons stating that he or she has been informed of and understands the effect of an order to terminate parental rights, and that he or she voluntarily disclaims all rights to the child, including the right to notice of further proceedings under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/badriver/council/code/1.25" title="Chapter 1.25 Children's Code">this chapter</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(5)">(5)</span> Any minor parent stating an intent to consent to the termination of parental rights shall have a guardian ad litem appointed for him or her by the court. The minor parent's consent to terminate rights shall not be accepted unless joined by his or her guardian ad litem. The consent of the guardian ad litem shall preclude later attack on the validity of the consent on the grounds of incompetence or minority.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> Petition.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)">(1)</span> A petition for termination of parental rights may only be filed by a child's parent or by the child welfare coordinator.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(1)">(1)</span> An initial hearing shall be held on a petition to terminate parental rights no later than 30 days after the filing of the petition.
